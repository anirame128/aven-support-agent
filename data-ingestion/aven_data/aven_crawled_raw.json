It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.1\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\nFor Cash Outs and Balance Transfers, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.4\nWhat is my monthly payment?\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. See Payment Calculator.\nCan I get cash too?\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.1\nDoes this affect my credit score?\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\nAre there any fees?\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don’t make the minimum payment.1\nWhy is the rate variable?\nSimilar to other credit cards, the rate is variable. It will vary based on the FFTR-UL as published in the Wall Street Journal, outside Aven's control. As the FFTR-UL shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, loans. The FFTR-UL may change several times a year.1 For Cash Outs and Balance Transfers we offer fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your monthly payment for 5 or 10 years.4\nWhy not get a traditional home equity line of credit instead?\nHome equity lines of credit often come with high fees (usually over $1000), minimum advances, minimum credit limits (often at least $50,000), and take 4-6 weeks to close.3 With Aven, you can get your card in just a few days in the mail, you can use it any number of times for any amount under your limit, with no origination or annual fees. Best of all, you get cash back on your purchases.1\nWhat are the criteria to qualify for this credit card?\n1) Own and have equity in your home. 2) Have an income that can support your monthly bill – we don’t want you to get into debt that you can’t afford. 3) Meet certain credit criteria, including credit score, income, and property value requirements.\nCredit card in the front.

Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven's control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.\n\nHow does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate?\n\nAven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\n\nDoes Aven offer a fixed rate?\n\nSome Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment, fixed rate Simple Loan plans. Applicants can check their details in their account agreement.\n\nIs Aven a credit card or a home equity line of credit?\n\nIt is both! Aven is a home equity line of credit that customers access through a credit card. Aven cardholders can use their Aven Card wherever VISA cards are accepted.\n\nAven cardholders can transfer cash directly from their Aven account to another bank account – it is called a CashOut. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\n\nTo transfer balance from a high interest credit card to the Aven card, cardholders can request a balance transfer (BT) to their credit card. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\n\nApplication\nHow long are applicant IDs and other records kept on file?\n\nTo comply with government recordkeeping requirements, we retain application and account records for at least 7 years. That includes applicant IDs.\n\nPayments\nWhen will my mailed check payment be posted to my account?\n\nWe prefer electronic payments through the Aven mobile app, or through your financial institution’s bill pay system. As a courtesy, we will accept check payments you mail us. It may take up to 5 business days for mail to be delivered by the post office. Once we receive the check, we will post it to your account within 5 business days. Check payments will be posted for the date it was received by Aven.\n\nCan I payback the full draw immediately if I don't need it right away?\n\nYes. Cardholders can pay back any balance amount at any time with no prepayment penalty.\n\nHow are payments calculated for fixed installment plans?\n\nAven offers fixed payment plans that amortize over several years, details being in the account agreement. The payment is calculated so that the entire amount of the plan and the interest is paid off by the end of the selected term. For payment estimates, please visit https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator \n\nHow do you compute my minimum due every month?\n\nFor revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan's minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. For payment estimates, please visit https://aven.com/paymentCalculator.\n\nIs there a prepayment penalty?\n\nThere is no a prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment. Cardholders can also find more details about their Account Agreement, here https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails\n\nImportant Note: If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released. Aven is unable to waive or shorten this wait period.\n\nHow is interest calculated on the Aven account?\n\nInterest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type.\n\nFor purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase.\nFor Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed.\nAny balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation.\n\nIn addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal.\n\nIf an account has zero balance in any cycle, there will be no payment due for that cycle.\n\nWhen is the monthly payment due?\n\nStatements are generated each month close to the monthly anniversary of when cardholders signed up for an Aven account. Payment due dates are highlighted in the statement as well as in the Aven Card app. Statements are available on the Aven app and online: https://my.aven.com/statements\n\nHow can I make a payment on my monthly statement?\n\nAven cardholders can pay their Aven bill using the Aven Card  app. Please note that Aven does not accept checks or cash by mail. https://my.aven.com/ \n\n \n\nDo missed payments impact a customer's home?\n\nOne or two late payments will not put a cardholders home at risk or in default. Aven offers multiple hardship services to cardholders who struggle with their payments. Please note that an account may be blocked if no payment is received by the time the next statement is issued.\n\nCan I pay with a check?\n\nAven cardholders can use the Aven Card app to easily connect their bank account using their routing and account number to make a payment. They can also use their existing online banking platforms to make payments to Aven. https://my.aven.com/ \n\nCan I add or remove bank accounts for Auto pay or bill pay?\n\nCardholders can add or remove bank accounts in the Aven Card app or online at https://my.aven.com/card \n\nDoes a purchase refund count against the minimum payment due?\n\nWhile a refunded purchase will reduce a customer's remaining statement balance, it will not count towards the minimum due payment - with one exception:\n\nif there is only one purchase during the cycle, and this purchase is refunded to bring the statement balance to zero, there will be no minimum payment for that cycle.\n\n \n\nSHOW LESS\nBefore You Apply\nWhat are the eligibility criteria for applying for the Aven Home Card?\n\nAven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated and generates an offer based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.

All signers must possess valid government issued identification documents specified by Aven. For lines above $100,000, borrowers need to provide proof of insurance and proof of adding Aven/Coastal Community Bank as a beneficiary on the policy.\n\nHow do you verify income?\n\nAven can verify income by securely connecting an applicant's bank account, or reviewing uploaded documents including Form 1040, a pay stub, W2, 1099-R, 1099-SSA, 1099-B, retirement income, benefit income. Aven's online application will specify the types of documents to upload.\n\nWill applying affect or impact my credit score?\n\nWhen you apply for an Aven card, we perform a “soft pull” on your credit in order to determine an offer. This does NOT impact the applicant's credit score. You can check your offer without your credit score being affected. \n\nOnly after you accept an offer and schedule a time with our notaries will we make a hard inquiry on your credit profile. This may impact the credit score.\n\nIs Aven a credit card or a home equity line of credit?\n\nIt is both! Aven is a home equity line of credit that customers access through a credit card.

We state this requirement at the top of the page in which the information is collected. This protected information in no way impacts an applicant’s offer, as required by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act. In fact, applicants have the opportunity to refuse disclosure of this information, as you did, nullifying any opportunity for discrimination.\n\nCan I pay off an existing HELOC with the Aven Card?\n\nAven offers a HELOC refinance product for qualified applicants.\n\nWhat credit score or FICO score do you use?\n\nAven uses FICO V9 and VantageScore 4.0 from Experian, a top credit reporting agency\n\nWhy do I have to wait the 3 business cancellation or rescission period?\n\nConsumer protection regulations require that applicants be given three business days to cancel the account because of the security interest in the home. You cannot use the card until the cancellation period (also known as a rescission period) has expired.\n\nThis regulation was established by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) under U.S. federal law, and allows a borrower to cancel a home equity loan, line of credit, or refinance with a new lender, within three days of closing.\n\nCan I apply or be eligible if my home is in a flood hazard zone?\n\nYes, Aven does support properties in flood zones.

NMLS #462289.\n\nWhat happens if I want to refinance?\n\n \n\nThere are generally two situations of refinancing:\n\nAven customer wants to refinance their first mortgage while keeping the Aven card open and active. In this case, Aven will work with the customer's first mortgage lender to complete a subordination agreement.\nAven customer wants to payoff and close the Aven account. In this case, the Aven customer needs to submit a payoff quote request from the Aven app or online. Please note that when Aven receives the payoff request, the account will be blocked from further charges. This is done to prevent the account balance increasing beyond the payoff quote. \nWhat happens when a house is sold?\n\nYour settlement agent will send Aven a payoff request. Aven will close the account and release the lien when the balance is paid in full.\n\nDo mortgage payments have to be current\n\nAven's underwriting system looks at mortgage payment history to determine an applicant's eligibility. The system will not accept applicants with mortgages that have been delinquent or have been in forbearance during the last 24 months.\n\nHow long is the offer valid for?\n\nApplicants have 30 calendar days to accept and finish signing, after which the offer will expire.

If someone has an Aven account and wishes to open another HELOC they will have to communicate with the other lender.\n\nSHOW LESS\nOffer, Rates & Fees\nIs there interest on a cash out fee?\n\nYes, the cash out transaction fee is added to the loan balance. Interest is calculated on the loan balance.\n\nWhat if I have SCRA Benefits?\n\nAven is grateful to service members for their sacrifices for our nation. Borrowers who are active duty service members of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, Reserve, and National Guard (consecutive 30 days or more currently active) need to inform Aven of their service details and provide supporting documentation such as deployment orders. Upon receipt, Aven will verify the information and adjust the Aven account to reflect the SCRA protections available to the borrower. For information regarding SCRA protections for active duty service members please click here.\n\nIs there an initial draw requirement?\n\nSome offers do have an initial draw requirement. See your account agreement for details. For cards with lines above $100,000, if the draw in the first 90 days is less than $50,000, Aven may reduce the line size to the amount outstanding, plus $25,000.\n\nWhich Index do you use?\n\n \n\nFor variable rate loans, Aven uses two different Indicies. Your Cardholder agreement will specify the Index used for your account.\n\n \n\nWall Street Journal Prime (WSJ Prime): The Wall Street Journal surveys some of the country's biggest banks and publishes a consensus rate based on the survey. This is one of the most common indicies used for many lending products. Look up the latest rates on the website of the Wall Street Journal. https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/moneyrates\n\n \n\nFederal Funds Target Rate - Upper Limit (FFTR-UL): This rate is set by the Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve (FOMC). It is the short-term interest rate at which U.S. Banks and Credit Unions lend to each other overnight within the Federal Reserve system. Look up the latest rates on the website of the St. Louis Fed. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=QGiM\n\n \n\nThe rate on your account is the sum of the index and the margin. Both can be found in your Account Agreement.\n\n \n\n \n\nDo you give a HUD-1?\n\n \n\nThere is no HUD-1 form associated with the Aven Home Card. The Account Agreement contains all the required information, notices, and disclosures.\n\nHow do applicants get higher credit limits?\n\nFor applicants, Aven's automated underwriting system cannot modify the credit limit or rate. Aven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated and generates an offer based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\n\nWhat is my monthly interest rate?\n\nA cardholder's monthly interest rate is their current APR, divided by 365, multiplied by the number of days in that monthly billing cycle.For fixed monthly payment plans, amount, term, and other details are presented and disclosed at the time of plan creation. Cardholders can find their current rates in the Aven App (under \"Account Details\").  The effective APR for each billing cycle is also printed in the statement..\n\nIs the rate variable?\n\nThe Aven Card is a variable rate credit card. Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven's control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.\n\nHow does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate?\n\nAven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\n\nIs Aven a simple interest loan or does it have an amortization schedule?\n\nAven offers several balance plans and some of them use the simple interest method of interest calculation. \n\nFor revolving balances, Aven uses the Average Daily Balance method of interest calculation. For each billing cycle, we add the interest bearing balance on each day of the cycle and divide it by the number of days in the cycle to get the Average Daily Balance for the billing cycle. We then calculate interest on this balance for the duration of the billing cycle, using the rate in effect on the last day of the billing cycle. Cardholders can find the rate used for the cycle on their statement in the \"Plan Summary\" section towards the end.\n\nFor fixed monthly payment plans, amount, term, and other details are presented and disclosed at the time of plan creation. (Some Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment fixed rate Installment plans for 5, 10, 15, or 30 years. Please check your account agreement to see if you have these plans.)\n\nFor payment estimates, please visit https://aven.com/paymentCalculator\n\nHow can someone get a lower rate compared to the offered?\n\nAven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated,  offers based on applicants’ income, equity, credit, and debt obligations. Aven can not adjust offers. \n\nDoes Aven offer a fixed rate?\n\nSome Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment, fixed rate Simple Loan plans. Applicants can check their details in their account agreement.\n\nWhat is the maximum line size?\n\nCurrently the maximum line size Aven offers is $250k. Aven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated and generates an offer based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\n\nAre there caps on rates?\n\nThe Aven Card rate will vary based on the Index - either Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) or the Federal Funds Target Rate - Upper Limit (FFTR-UL) set by the Federal Reserve. Please look at your account agreement for which the Index is used in your account. The maximum APR is 18%. The latest WSJ Prime Rate and FFTR-UL Rate can be found on the public internet at the Wall Street Journal webpage, or the Federal Reserve webpage. \n\nAre there any origination or annual fees?\n\nThe Aven Card comes without application fees, annual fees, or account closing fees. Select offers for some customers might include first-draw fees, clearly indicated at the time of the offer.\n\nWould the effective interest rate stay the same for fixed monthly payment plans?\n\nThe effective interest rate may vary for fixed monthly payment plans. On the day a cardholder sets up a fixed monthly payment plan, the rate is calculated as the account's current variable rate + a Fixed Rate premium (For some Aven cardholders, it may vary, see your account agreement). \n\nSHOW LESS\nApplication\nA co-owner is deceased and I am trying to open an account.

Your statement balance does not equal your payoff amount and sending a payment for the balance might delay the payoff process and the account’s closing.\n \n\nThe account will be reported as closed to the credit bureau(s) at the end of the current billing cycle. If the payoff results in a credit balance, the credit balance will be refunded via ACH or by check.\n\n \n\nFor payoffs by certified funds (wires or cashier’s checks), the lien release will be sent to the county recorder within 5 business days after the funds are final. Any payment by non-certified funds (personal checks, direct deposit or e-check from your bank's bill payment system, ACH, etc.) may result in an up to 60 day delay prior to the lien release being sent to the county.

What happens if only one of us loses their job while we are enrolled in Debt Protection?\n\nIf either of the co-borrowers experiences involuntary unemployment, the account will be covered for the coverage listed above.\n\nWhat happens if I don’t pay the Debt Protection fee?\n\nIf you don’t pay your Debt Protection fees, the loan addendum will be considered lapsed and you will not be eligible to file a claim in the event of involuntary unemployment. Even if you are not able to pay your minimum monthly payment for Aven, as long as you pay your Debt Protection fees, you will be eligible to file a claim. \n\nCan I appeal a claim decision for Debt Protection?\n\nThere is no option to appeal at this time. Securian's claim decision is final.\n\nDo I need to be current on my account to file a Debt Protection claim?\n\nNo. You may file a claim even if you are delinquent.

Please note, if a claim is successful, it will not bring your account current.\n\nAre there any exclusions to filing a claim for Debt Protection?\n\nDebt protection is not possible in the following cases: \n\nA customer retires, quits, or resigns\nA claim occurs in first 90 days of issuance\nA claim occurs on or after 70th birthday\nHow do I file a claim for Debt Protection?\n\nEmail us at support@aven.com or go to the Debt Protection tab located in the sidebar menu of your Aven mobile application.\n\nThere you will see a link to file a claim. You will be routed to Securian Financial - our claims administrator - to provide details related to your job loss event and submit documentation.\n\nOnce a decision has been made, Securian Financial will notify you and Aven and issue a payment to Aven under the contractual liability policy. Please note that the cancellation date would be effective as of the date of unemployment.\n\nHow are Debt Protection fees calculated?\n\nThe monthly rate charged is $0.92 per $1,000 of balances for single accounts and $1.75 per $1,000 of balances for joint accounts.\n\n \n\nFor example, if you have $30,000 of outstanding balances at your statement date, you would see a $27.60 charge as a single account holder and a $52.50 charge as a joint account holder in the following statement. Fees are always paid for balances in arrears. \n\n \n\nThis fee will show up on your monthly statement as a separate charge. As long as you are current on paying these fees, you will be able to file a claim in the event of involuntary job loss. \n\nHow much am I covered for with Debt Protection? Are there any limitations with Debt Protection?\n\nDebt Protection covers participating customers up to $50,000 in total payments and up to $1,000 in monthly payments for up to 6 months. Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence.\n\n \n\nAs an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.\n\n \n\nPlease note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current. \n\nIs Debt Protection considered an insurance product? How does Debt Protection work?\n\nNo, Debt Protection is not an insurance protection. Anyone who elects to join will sign an addendum to their loan agreement with Aven. In the event of involuntary job loss, Aven will cancel up to six months of a borrower’s monthly payments per occurrence of job loss if the claim is approved. \n\n \n\nAven maintains a contractual liability policy and administrative services agreement with Securian Financial. In the event of a Debt Protection claim, Securian would approve it and reimburse funds to Aven Financial.\n\nWho is eligible for Debt Protection?\n\nIn order to qualify, you must:\n\nBe under 70 years old\nActively work a minimum of 24 hours per week\nNot be self-employed\nWhat is Debt Protection?\n\nFor a small monthly fee, you can protect yourself and your home for up to six months per occurrence of involuntary job loss. Aven makes no money from this offering - we offer it strictly for the benefit of any customers who are worried about potentially losing their home. \n\n \n\nPlease note, this product is only meant to help you manage your Aven card. Aven may still foreclose if the max monthly claim payment from debt protection is not sufficient to cover the minimum monthly payment due. Additionally, your first lien holder may still foreclose if you fall into default on mortgage payments. \n\nSHOW LESS\nCan't find what you need?\nSearch question, keywords, or topics\nMessage Us\nSchedule A Callback\n\nAVEN\n\nCard\n\nHow It Works\n\nTestimonials\n\nApp\n\nAbout Us\n\nCareers\n\nRESOURCES\n\nPress\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms of Service\n\nPay It Forward\n\nLicenses\n\nDisclosures\n\n© 2025 Aven\n\nThe annual percentage rate (“APR”) is the cost of credit as a yearly rate and does not include costs other than interest.

It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.1\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\nFor Cash Outs and Balance Transfers, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.4\nWhat is my monthly payment?\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. See Payment Calculator.\nCan I get cash too?\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.1\nDoes this affect my credit score?\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\nAre there any fees?\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don’t make the minimum payment.1\nWhy is the rate variable?\nSimilar to other credit cards, the rate is variable. It will vary based on the FFTR-UL as published in the Wall Street Journal, outside Aven's control. As the FFTR-UL shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, loans. The FFTR-UL may change several times a year.1 For Cash Outs and Balance Transfers we offer fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your monthly payment for 5 or 10 years.4\nWhy not get a traditional home equity line of credit instead?\nHome equity lines of credit often come with high fees (usually over $1000), minimum advances, minimum credit limits (often at least $50,000), and take 4-6 weeks to close.3 With Aven, you can get your card in just a few days in the mail, you can use it any number of times for any amount under your limit, with no origination or annual fees. Best of all, you get cash back on your purchases.1\nWhat are the criteria to qualify for this credit card?\n1) Own and have equity in your home. 2) Have an income that can support your monthly bill – we don’t want you to get into debt that you can’t afford. 3) Meet certain credit criteria, including credit score, income, and property value requirements.\nCredit card in the front.

The APR is a variable rate based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate (“Index”) published by the Wall Street Journal in its Money Rates section. The WSJ Prime Rate as of Jan 10th, 2025 EST is 7.50%. Your initial APR is based on a margin, determined by your creditworthiness when you open your account, plus the Index at the time of application. Your APR is subject to change as allowed by applicable law. Best rates available only to the highest-qualified borrowers. The maximum APR will not exceed 18% during the life of your account. Cash Out (draw to bank account) fee and Balance Transfer fee is 2.5% of amount transferred. This fee is subject to change. The county where your property is located may charge recording fees. If your line is greater than $25,000, you are responsible for paying these costs. These costs will be placed in a 12-month interest free, fixed term loan and be part of your Minimum Payment Due.\n\nYou are not required to sign up for AutoPay. To receive a 0.25 percentage point discount to your APR, you must enroll in AutoPay by the end of your first billing cycle and maintain AutoPay. This discount is available to new cardholders only.

The source of the average interest rate on credit card plans comes from FRED.\n\nFor fixed rate plans – (1) for each month, we determine the interest savings by multiplying (a) our current fixed rate balances by (b) our balance-weighted average APR minus the average interest rate for 5 year fixed personal loans and (c) then dividing by 12; (2) we then sum up the interest savings over all months since the company’s launch.

Look no further! In this comprehensive article, we'll examine two popular credit cards—the Home Depot Credit Card and the Aven Home EquityCredit Card—that cater to individuals like you, aiming to streamline their home improvement expenses or optimize their balance transfer strategies.\n\n\t\n\nHome Depot2\n\n\t\n\nAven\n\n\n\n\nCard Type\n\n\t\n\nStore Specific\n\n\t\n\nGeneral Purpose\n\n\n\n\nRewards\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\t\n\n2% Cashback1\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Fee\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\nAPR\n\n\t\n\n17.99% - 26.99\n\n\t\n\n7.99% - 14.99%1\n\n\n\n\nCredit Limit\n\n\t\n\nNot Specified\n\n\t\n\nUp to $250,000\n\n\n\n\nProcess\n\n\t\n\nLess stringent\n\n\t\n\nStricter criteria\n\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\t\n\nSpecial financing options, extended return windows\n\n\t\n\nLarge lines, low rates, option to cash out, cash back\n\n\n\t\n\nApply Now\n\n\t\n\nApply Now\n\nApply Now\n\nWhen it comes to revamping your living space or dealing with existing credit card debt, having the right credit card can be a game-changer. That's why we're here to break down the unique features, rewards, fees, and benefits of these two credit cards, empowering you to make an informed decision based on your specific needs and financial goals.\n\nCard Features and Rewards:\n\nThe Aven Home Equity Credit Card is a general-purpose credit card that can be used anywhere VISA is accepted. It offers cash back rewards on everyday purchases. These rewards can be redeemed for statement credits.\n\nOn the other hand, the Home Depot Credit Card offers various benefits such as special financing options and access to exclusive cardholder events. The card provides a range of promotional financing offers, including deferred interest and fixed monthly payments, depending on the purchase amount.\n\nAnnual Fees and Interest Rates:\n\nThe Aven Home Equity Credit Card has no annual fee or sign up fee. It has an extremely low interest rate, making it an attractive choice for those looking to save on interest charges.\n\nThe Home Depot Credit Card does not charge an annual fee. However, it's important to note that the card has a relatively high APR (Annual Percentage Rate), which can be significant if you carry a balance from month to month.\n\nCredit Limit and Approval Process:\n\nThe Home Depot Credit Card typically offers a lower credit limit compared to the Aven Home Equity Credit Card. This is because it is primarily designed for Home Depot purchases and not intended for extensive everyday use. The approval process for the Home Depot Credit Card may be less stringent, making it more accessible to a wider range of credit profiles.\n\nThe Aven Home Equity Credit Card, being a general-purpose credit card, generally offers higher credit limits. However, the approval process may involve stricter criteria, including credit history and income verification, to qualify for higher credit limits.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBoth the Home Depot Credit Card and the Aven Home Equity Credit Card have their own strengths and cater to different consumer needs. If you are a regular Home Depot shopper, the Home Depot Credit Card can provide you with attractive financing options. However, if you prefer a more versatile credit card with rewards on everyday spending and a wider range of perks, the Aven Home Equity Credit Card may be a better fit.\n\nConsider your spending habits, credit profile, and specific needs before making a decision. Ultimately, choosing the right credit card depends on your personal preferences, financial goals, and the benefits that align with your lifestyle.\n\nApply Now\n\nAVEN\n\nCard\n\nHow It Works\n\nTestimonials\n\nApp\n\nAbout Us\n\nCareers\n\nRESOURCES\n\nPress\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms of Service\n\nPay It Forward\n\nLicenses\n\nDisclosures\n\n© 2025 Aven\n\nThe annual percentage rate (“APR”) is the cost of credit as a yearly rate and does not include costs other than interest.

This article also explains where you can use your card and how it differs from the credit cards in your wallet.\n\nHow to get a HELOC Card\n\nTo use a traditional HELOC, you typically need to transfer funds to a checking account before making purchases or use special checks issued to you by the lender. This process can be complicated, time-consuming and frustrating. Some lenders will instead give you a HELOC Card to use at your convenience so you can access your funds immediately.\n\nHowever, there are several requirements to be eligible to apply, including: proving you have a steady income, being listed on your home’s title, having a certain credit score and possessing a valid ID. If you meet the requirements, the application process typically looks something like this:\n\nComplete the online application, which asks questions about yourself and your home\nVerify your income by providing pay stubs or a company verification letter\nMeet with a notary to sign required documents\nReceive your card within a few business days\nWhere can HELOC funds be used?\n\nOnce your card arrives in the mail, you can start making purchases with it right away. You can use your card at any merchant that accepts major credit cards, like Visa and MasterCard.\n\nExperts recommend using a HELOC Card for purchases that help increase wealth over the long run. For example, many homeowners tend to use their funds on home improvements or remodeling, which can significantly increase the property’s value. You can also use the card to transfer balances from personal loans or other credit cards.\n\nWhile there are no restrictions on what products or services you can purchase with a HELOC Card, financial advisors typically advise against using your card on frivolous items or experiences, such as vacations or a new car, which are unlikely to increase your wealth. These types of purchases could even make it harder to pay off your HELOC balance in the future.\n\nHow to pay for charges made on a HELOC Card\n\nEvery month, you will receive a statement with your charges, much like you do with a traditional credit card. The monthly bill for a HELOC Card from Aven, for example, consists of 1% of the principal balance plus finance and interest charges on the average daily balance during your last billing cycle.\n\nIf you choose to pay only your minimum balance each month, it can take you a very long time to pay your balance back. You can choose to pay more than the minimum or to make payments more often than once a month if you'd like to pay down your debt sooner. If you can't pay your monthly bill on time, you will likely incur a late fee.\n\nHow is a HELOC Card different from a credit card?\n\nWhile a HELOC Card is used in a similar way as a regular credit card, they are not the same. The main difference is that a HELOC Card uses your home’s equity to secure the loan, while a credit card doesn’t require any collateral. Consequently, HELOC Cards have much lower interest rates than credit cards. However, unlike with a credit card, the rate is usually variable, meaning it moves up and down based on a benchmark rate.\n\nAre you looking for a HELOC Card? Aven is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back.

If so, you have probably thought about getting a second mortgage in the form of a loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC). But did you know it is possible to access your funds instantly using a credit card? This article explains the concept of a HELOC Card, how it’s different from a traditional HELOC, as well as the benefits and disadvantages.\n\nWhat is a HELOC?\n\nLet’s first explore what a HELOC is. With this type of loan you borrow funds against the equity you’ve built in your home: the value minus the outstanding balance on the primary mortgage. You can use the funds whenever you need cash, and you do not pay interest on unused funds. Because your house is used as collateral in exchange for funds, HELOCs typically come with competitive interest rates versus other types of loans. However, HELOC interest rates are generally variable, meaning they move up or down based on a benchmark rate, like the federal funds rate. For that reason, it’s important to consider the maximum rate for your HELOC when deciding whether or not to open one.\n\nThere are two phases of a HELOC: The draw period, which typically lasts five to 10 years, and the repayment period, which usually lasts 10 to 20 years. During the draw period, you can use the line of credit much like an ordinary credit card: borrow cash, repay debt, and borrow more cash. You’re only required to pay for what you spend, plus interest. During the repayment phase, borrowing stops and the focus shifts to paying down debt in the form of monthly principal and interest payments.\n\nWhat can a HELOC be used for?\n\nHELOCs are oftentimes used to pay for home improvements and remodeling, which can help increase the value of the home. In addition, the interest on a HELOC may be tax-deductible if used to purchase, build or make significant improvements to a home.\n\nHowever, there are risks to consider. Because the interest rate is variable, an increase could make it more difficult to keep up with monthly payments and, consequently, increase the risk of foreclosure.\n\nWhat is a HELOC Card?\n\nNow that you understand what a HELOC is, let's talk about HELOC Cards. A HELOC Card allows you to access funds immediately to pay for items and services when you need them. This card acts just like a credit card and can be used anywhere credit cards are accepted, but typically has a much lower interest rate because it is secured by your home equity. HELOC cards can also be used to transfer balances from other credit cards and personal loans.\n\nBenefits of HELOC Cards\n\nThere are several benefits to a HELOC Card. You can use it anytime, anywhere, just like any other credit card, and get instant access to your line of credit. The interest rate on your card is usually lower than other credit cards because it uses your home as collateral. If you use your HELOC Card to pay for home improvements, the interest on your HELOC Card may be tax-deductible, and you never pay interest on unused funds.\n\nCompared with a regular HELOC, a HELOC Card may have significantly lower fees, and you may be avoiding the high credit minimums that ordinary HELOCs require. It can also be much faster to receive a HELOC Card than to get a traditional HELOC.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nA HELOC is a line of credit backed by your home equity. This type of loan is typically suitable for purchases that help build wealth, such as home improvements or remodelings, but can also be used for other purposes, such as paying off high-interest credit card debt or personal loans.\nHELOCs commonly have low interest rates, though they’re variable and move up or down based on a benchmark rate.\nA HELOC Card allows you to access your funds immediately when you need them and works just like any other credit card. It may be faster to acquire than a traditional HELOC and may also incur significantly lower fees.\n\nAre you looking for a HELOC Card? Aven is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back.

But what is home equity, what can you do with it and how do you tap into it? Keep reading to find out.\n\nWhat is Home Equity?\n\nHome equity is the portion of your home that you have already paid off. It is calculated by subtracting your outstanding mortgage and loan balances from the current market value of your home. For example, if you put 20% down on a house that is worth $200,000 and take out a mortgage to cover the remaining $160,000, then you would have $40,000 of equity in your home. As you pay off the mortgage, your home equity increases until you own your home in its entirety.\n\nHow can I use my Home Equity to access funds?\n\nWhen you have home equity, you can use that equity as collateral to borrow money in the form of a home equity loan, home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a reverse mortgage. Interest rates on these types of loans tend to be lower than on other types of loans because they are secured by the portion of your home that you own. Choosing an option depends on what you wish to do with the extra cash.\n\nHOME EQUITY LOAN\n\nA Home Equity Loan, otherwise known as a second mortgage, is one way to borrow against your home equity and receive all the money in one lump sum at a fixed interest rate. You then make monthly principal and interest payments to pay it off. This type of loan can be useful if you need cash to make a large, one-time payment. A home renovation is a good example. It could also be used to consolidate high-interest debt.\n\nHOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT (HELOC)\n\nAnother option is a home equity line of credit or HELOC. A HELOC also uses your home equity as collateral. However, rather than receiving all your money at once, you get access to a line of credit from which you can withdraw money as you need it. The beauty of a HELOC is that you only pay interest on what you use.\n\nThere are two stages of a HELOC. The first is the draw period, during which you can withdraw as much money as you need up to the credit limit. The second is the repayment period, which is when you pay off the debt. Interest rates on HELOCs are usually adjustable, and your monthly payments will vary. A HELOC is a good option if you want to make many smaller improvements to your home over an extended period of time, or if you're not exactly sure how much money you will need.\n\nREVERSE MORTGAGE\n\nLastly, if you are at least 62 years old, a reverse mortgage is another choice to consider. As the name suggests, a reverse mortgage is the opposite of a traditional mortgage. Instead of making payments to a lender to earn equity in your home, the lender makes payments to you. Your debt to the lender increases, and your equity decreases as the lender buys it from you. You remain the title holder of your home, but when you sell it, pass away, or move out for more than a year, the loan becomes due. The lender will then sell the house to recover the funds you borrowed, and any remaining equity falls to you or your heirs.\n\nReverse mortgages are most commonly used by elderly adults since you need to be at least 62 years old to apply for one. They can be a good alternative when you want to retire but don't have enough savings and assets to do so. If you are considering a reverse mortgage, make sure to do your research, read the fine print and consult an attorney because scams are common.\n\nWhat is a Home Equity Line of Credit Card?\n\nWhile there are advantages to each of the options mentioned above, the application and approval process can take a few weeks, and getting access to your funds can be a hassle. Perhaps the easiest and fastest way to access your funds is with a HELOC Card, which is similar to a traditional HELOC, but without the need for a checkbook or online transfers. A HELOC Card works just like a credit card and can be used anywhere credit cards are accepted. There are lenders, like Aven, that specialize in these cards and in speeding up the approval process.\n\nTo apply for a HELOC Card, you will need to meet a few requirements like having a stable income, a credit score of around 650 and around 20% equity in your home. Unlike with a traditional HELOC, the entire process can be completed online and doesn’t usually require a home appraisal. All you need to do is answer a few questions about yourself and your home, confirm your income by uploading pay stubs or logging into your bank account and complete an online notarization session to sign paperwork. To learn more about the requirements and steps to getting a HELOC Card as quickly as possible, check out this article.\n\nWhich option is right for me?\n\nDeciding which option is best depends on many factors, including what you need the money for and how quickly you need access to it. A home equity loan may be best for well-thought out projects with a known cost, while a HELOC is better for ongoing projects in which the costs are variable. However, if you need your funds quickly and want a convenient way to access them, a HELOC Card may be what you're looking for.\n\nHave you decided a HELOC Card is worth looking into?

But how do you apply, and what is the fastest way to get approved and get access to those funds?\n\nGetting a HELOC the Traditional Way\n\nTo qualify for a traditional HELOC, you will need to meet a few requirements in regards to your income, credit and percentage of equity in your home. The exact requirements vary by lender, but let's take a look at the most common conditions.\n\nThe first and, arguably, most important metric lenders look at when you apply for a HELOC is your credit score. Most lenders require a FICO® score of at least 620 to qualify for a HELOC, but the minimum could be set as high as 680. Some will approve you with a score under 620 if you have a low debt-to-income ratio or a high percentage of equity in your home.\n\nAs mentioned above, your debt-to-income ratio also matters. This ratio tells a lender whether or not you can afford to make payments on your line of credit, and is calculated by totaling your monthly debt payments, as well as other financial obligations, and dividing that number by your total monthly income. The resulting percentage is your debt-to-income ratio. Most lenders abide by guidelines set by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which recommends a debt-to-income ratio below 43%. Regardless, the lower this percentage, the easier it will be to qualify for a HELOC. Lenders will also evaluate your payment history on other loans to ensure you make payments on time and determine how risky it will be to lend you money.\n\nYou will also need to prove that you have a steady income so that lenders can be confident you’ll pay back your line of credit. Typically, providing pay stubs or your most recent W-2 is sufficient.\n\nNext, you need to have enough equity in your home. Lenders usually look for at least 15 to 20 percent of equity compared to your home’s value. To determine your equity, subtract the amount you owe on your mortgage from the current value of your home. For example, if you owe $200,000 on your mortgage and your home is valued at $350,000, your home equity is $150,000 (or 43%).\n\nOnce the lender has received and evaluated the above information, you’ll receive an initial decision within a few days. However, rather than taking your word for it, many lenders will perform a home appraisal of their own to confirm the equity amount. This process involves a professional visiting your property to assess its value based on location, age, recent home improvements, curb appeal, nearby attractions and the current housing market.\n\nThe above steps can take a few weeks to complete before you receive a final decision on whether or not you have qualified for a HELOC, and you will likely pay fees associated with the service. Then, once you get a green light from the lender, you’ll need to visit the office to sign paperwork and then wait about three days before accessing your funds through online transfer or issued checks. The entire process can take a month or longer, and typically involves closing costs of 2% to 5% of the loan amount, as well as fees for origination, appraisal, inactivity and early termination.\n\nGetting a HELOC Card\n\nDon’t have a month to wait? A HELOC Card might be a better option. A HELOC Card is backed by your home’s equity, just like a traditional HELOC, but it can take as little as 15 minutes to qualify. To apply, you will still need a credit score in the mid-600s, depending on your equity and debt-to-income ratio, proof of a steady income and enough equity in your home.\n\nHowever, you may be allowed to skip the home appraisal (eliminating any appraisal fees) and sign the closing documents via an online notarization session, which substantially shortens the approval process. The card typically arrives in the mail within 5-10 days, and after the three-day waiting period, you can use it anywhere credit cards are accepted.\n\nA HELOC Card also has significantly lower fees than a traditional HELOC. Skipping the appraisal means you’ll only incur charges for late payments, insufficient funds, and taking out cash.\n\nDeciding between a HELOC Card and traditional HELOC\n\nWhen considering whether a traditional HELOC or a HELOC Card is the right choice for you, keep the similarities and differences discussed above in mind. Some people may feel more comfortable signing papers in person or may want to give their favorite bank their business. If this sounds like you, a traditional HELOC may be the way to go. However, if you're looking for the fastest and most affordable way to make your home equity work for you, a HELOC Card may be the best option.\n\nAre you considering applying for a HELOC and looking for the fastest way to do it?

But what is it, what can it be used for and when is a HELOC a good idea?\n\nKey Takeaways\nA HELOC is a line of credit backed by your home equity and can be a good idea when you're looking for a way to free up cash for home improvements.\nThere are other options to consider, depending on your situation, and what you want to use the funds for.\nIf a HELOC sounds like a good idea, consider a HELOC Card for a more efficient way to access your funds.\nWhat is a HELOC?\n\nA HELOC, or Home Equity Line of Credit, is a type of loan that uses your home equity as collateral. If you own at least 20% of your home, you may be able to use that equity to secure a HELOC. A HELOC works like a credit card in the sense that you can use the money when and where you need it. However, interest rates on HELOCs tend to be more competitive because the loan is backed by your home equity. In addition, rates are adjustable and move up or down based on a benchmark rate, such as the federal funds rate. During the initial draw period, which typically lasts five to 10 years, you can pay off your debt and borrow again as much as you’d like. You’ll only pay interest on the amount you withdraw. Then comes the repayment period, during which you pay down your debt by making monthly principal and interest payments.\n\nWhat are the alternatives to a HELOC?\n\nBefore settling on a HELOC, you may want to consider other options. Depending on your situation, and what you want to use the funds for, another type of loan may suit your situation better. Let's take a look at some of the alternatives so that you can decide whether a HELOC is a good idea for you.\n\nHOME EQUITY LOAN\n\nA Home Equity Loan, also known as a Second Mortgage, is backed by your home equity, just like a HELOC. The main difference is that this loan is paid out as a lump sum, and once it’s taken out, that’s it. You can’t access additional funds, and when the debt is repaid, the loan is closed. The interest rate for this type of loan is typically fixed. A Home Equity loan can be used to consolidate high-interest debt or to fund home renovations when you have a plan and already know more or less how much you will spend.\n\nCASH-OUT MORTGAGE REFINANCE\n\nA Cash-Out Mortgage Refinance may also be a good option if you're looking to make some home improvements. This type of loan replaces your existing mortgage with a loan for more money than you currently owe on your house, and the difference is paid out to you in cash. Your monthly mortgage payments will be higher as a result. Like the Home Equity Loan above, once you’re finished originating the loan, it’s done; you cannot draw additional funds like you would on a HELOC.\n\nREVERSE MORTGAGE\n\nIf you are older than 62, a Reverse Mortgage is another choice. As the name suggests, this type of loan works in the opposite way of a traditional mortgage: The lender makes payments to you in exchange for equity in your home, and your equity decreases as your debt increases. The loan balance doesn’t become due until you sell the property or pass away. This type of loan can be a good alternative when you want to retire but don't have enough savings and assets to do so. Scams are common, so do your research and be careful.\n\nPERSONAL LOAN\n\nAnother option to look into is a Personal Loan, which could be unsecured or secured against something valuable - like a car, for example. Personal Loans are often used to consolidate credit card debt or other high-interest debt, but keep in mind that the interest rates for personal loans can also be high compared with a HELOC.\n\nAdvantages of a HELOC\n\nThere are a few advantages of choosing a HELOC over the types of loans described above. First, the interest rates are usually lower than for other kinds of loans. Secondly, some lenders offer low or no closing cost and some may not charge fees for withdrawing cash. Finally, if you use your funds for home improvements or renovations, the interest on your HELOC may be tax-deductible.\n\nWhen is a HELOC a Good Idea?\n\nA HELOC may be the best choice if you are looking to use the funds for home improvements or renovations, which will increase the value of your home. It’s an especially good option if you’re unsure how much money you will need for the project because you’re able to withdraw funds as you go, while only paying interest on what you use. On the other hand, if you’re looking to free up cash for something like a car, which will not increase your wealth, another type of loan may be less risky. As discussed, a HELOC is backed by your home equity, which puts your home at risk should you not be able to pay back your debt.\n\nWhat is a HELOC Card?\n\nIf you've determined a HELOC is a good idea for you, consider getting a HELOC Card. It can take weeks to receive approval for a traditional HELOC, while a HELOC Card takes as little as 15 minutes and allows you to skip the home appraisal process. Once approved, the card arrives in the mail in a few days. After a three-day waiting period, you'll be free to use the card anywhere credit cards are accepted. With a traditional HELOC, you will usually need to use a special checkbook or online transfers to access your funds.\n\nDoes a HELOC seem like a good idea?

A Beginner’s Guide\nPUBLISHED JUL 21, 2021 | 3 MIN READ\n\nThere are many options to consider when you need to free up cash for a project or purchase, such as credit card cash advances, personal loans, reverse mortgages and home equity loans. But have you ever considered a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), which allows you to tap into your home equity to fund home improvements or renovations? If you haven’t, read on to discover how a HELOC works and why it may be a good option for you.\n\nKey Takeaways\nA HELOC is a line of credit that is backed by the equity you have in your home, meaning your house is used as collateral to secure the loan.\nA HELOC is recommended for investments that will increase your wealth, such as home improvements. It's not recommended for day-to-day living expenses or expensive purchases like cars or vacations.\nHELOC rates are determined using a baseline rate, typically the prime rate, and your credit profile. Typically, the higher your credit score, the lower the rate.\nHELOC rates are variable, meaning they move up or down in accordance with the benchmark rate. Remember to check your HELOC's maximum rate when applying to avoid a costly surprise.\nWhat is a HELOC?\n\nA HELOC is a line of credit backed by the equity you have in your home: the value of your home minus what you owe on your mortgage. A HELOC uses your home equity as collateral and lets you borrow against it.\n\nFor example, let's say you make a down payment of 20% on a house worth $200,000 and take out a mortgage to cover the rest. That means you initially have $40,000 worth of equity in your home, which increases as you make monthly payments on your mortgage. If you have at least 20% equity in your home (and meet a few other requirements - read more here), you may qualify for a HELOC.\n\nA HELOC consists of two phases. The first is the draw period, which usually lasts five to 10 years, and the repayment period, which can last 10 to 20 years. During the draw period, you are free to use your line of credit at your discretion, up to your limit. It functions much like a credit card: borrow cash, repay it and borrow again. You also only pay interest on what you use. When the draw period is over, the repayment phase begins. This is where you make monthly principal and interest payments to pay back what you've borrowed during the draw phase.\n\nHow are HELOC rates determined?\n\nHELOC interest rates are determined based on a benchmark interest rate, typically the prime rate, as well as your credit profile. Depending on your credit score, the lender will add a markup to the benchmark rate. Typically, the lower your credit score, the higher the interest you’ll have to pay. If you have an excellent credit history, your rate could be as low as 3%, while if your credit is below average, it could be as high as 9-10%.\n\nBecause HELOCs are secured by home equity, the interest rates tend to be lower than with other types of loans. However, they are variable, meaning your rate will move up and down over time with the benchmark rate it is tied to. This means your monthly payments may increase, making it harder to keep up with payments. It is critical to consider this and check the maximum rate for your HELOC when deciding if it’s the right choice for you.\n\nHow do homeowners benefit from HELOCs?\n\nThe biggest benefit of a HELOC is the ability to withdraw funds as you go and only pay interest on what you use, unlike other loans that require you to take out a lump sum and pay interest on the entire balance from the get-go. In addition, if the HELOC funds are used to pay for home improvement projects and renovations, which boost the value of the property over time, the interest may be tax-deductible. To learn more, read here about when a HELOC may (or may not) be a good idea.\n\nHow do lenders benefit from offering HELOCs?\n\nFor lenders, HELOCs offer protection if things go downhill because the borrower’s property serves as collateral. If a borrower defaults on payments, the bank could ultimately take ownership of the home and sell it to pay off the loan. For this reason, it's best not to use the funds to pay for vacations, cars, groceries, or anything that will make it more difficult to pay off your monthly principal and interest payments.\n\nAre you considering applying for a HELOC?

When trying to decide what kind of loan is best suited to you and your situation, it's essential to know the differences between the two and the benefits and drawbacks of each. This article will explain how each type of loan works and explore what the key similarities and differences are.\n\nKey Takeaways\nMortgages and HELOCs are two types of loans that both use your property as collateral. This means that if you end up defaulting on your payments, you can end up losing your home.\nA mortgage is a fixed amount used to purchase property, while a HELOC is a revolving line of credit typically tapped for home improvements or renovations after a home is already bought.\nA mortgage can have a fixed or variable interest rate. Most HELOCs have variable interest rates.\nMortgages and HELOCs share a lot of the same requirements for eligibility, such as a good credit score, Debt-to-Income Ratio at 43% or lower, and a steady income.\nGetting a HELOC is usually quicker than getting a mortgage. However, the timeline varies a lot and depends on your lender and location, among other things.\nHow Does a Mortgage Work?\n\nA mortgage is a loan used to purchase property when you don’t wish to buy it outright using cash. Instead of paying the whole amount that the home is worth upfront, you make a down payment (the general rule of thumb is at least 20% of the total price), and get a mortgage to cover the rest. The home you are buying serves as collateral for the loan. The mortgage, which includes a principal amount and interest, is paid back in monthly installments over a determined period of time. Once you've paid off the whole amount you owe, you will own the property in its entirety. Mortgage rates can be either adjustable or fixed.\n\nTo be eligible for a mortgage, you need to meet certain requirements. The lender will typically run a credit check, and the higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate and mortgage payment will generally be. For a conventional mortgage, a score of 620 or higher is often required.\n\nYou will need to prove to the lender that you have a steady income. This can be done by showing proof of employment, pay stubs, tax returns, and other documents. The lender also looks at your mortgage reserves – cash or any assets you have that can be easily converted into cash if you were to find yourself facing financial hardship and struggling to make payments. Investments in stocks, bonds, and funds, and money in checkings and savings accounts are some of the liquid assets that may be considered reserves.\n\nThe lender will also look at your DTI or Debt-to-Income Ratio. This is calculated by dividing your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) recommends a DTI of 43% or less.\n\nThe process of getting a mortgage begins with you applying to a mortgage lender. The lender will first verify if you meet the requirements and will be able to pay back the loan. If you are approved, they will come back with an offer of a loan at a specific interest rate to be repaid over a set amount of time. If you accept the lender's offer, you will go through a closing process, where you meet with the seller of the property to pay the down payment, have them sign over the property to you, and sign documents.\n\nFilling out the paperwork for the mortgage application won’t take long, but getting approved, having the appraisal done, receiving a final offer and finalizing the closing procedure can be a lengthy process. After researching mortgages and finding a property you want to purchase (which can also take quite some time), you’re looking at a timeline of approximately two months before you have the keys in your hand. According to Ellie Mae, a software company that processes mortgage applications, the average time to close purchase mortgage loans was 51 days in March 2021. Because there are so many steps in the process, however, there is no guaranteed timeline and the amount of time it takes to get a mortgage varies greatly.\n\nThe mortgage process also comes with a closing cost, which can include origination and appraisal fees, real estate commissions, taxes, insurance fees, title fees and more. The average closing cost is around 3-6% of the purchase price, but it varies depending on your mortgage lender, location and loan type.\n\nHow Does a HELOC Work?\n\nA Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is a type of loan that lets you borrow against home equity, typically to spend on repairs and improvements of the property. It uses your home as collateral, just like a mortgage. However, unlike a mortgage, a HELOC gives you access to a revolving line of credit from which you can borrow money, pay it back, and borrow again during the first phase of the loan called the draw period. During this time, you usually only pay interest on what funds you actually borrow. The draw period generally lasts five to 10 years and is followed by the repayment period, where you pay back your remaining balance through monthly payments of principal and interest. HELOC rates are typically adjustable and vary over time.\n\nTo be eligible for a HELOC, you need to meet a lot of the same requirements as for a mortgage, except for the mortgage reserves.\n\nJust like with a mortgage, the lender will look at your Debt-to-Income Ratio, which needs to be 43% or lower. You will also still need a credit score of around 620, depending on your DTI and the amount of equity you have in your home.\n\nThe home equity you own is the current price of your property minus any balance you owe on mortgages and loans against it, calculated as a percentage. To be eligible to apply for a HELOC, the minimum equity required is typically about 15-20%.\n\nHELOC lenders will also want to know that you can make payments and will therefore require you to prove employment and a steady income as well. Read more about the HELOC application process here.\n\nWhen you apply for a HELOC, the lender evaluates the above-mentioned information to determine if you are a good candidate for a line of credit. If you meet the requirements, the lender will give you an initial offer. Following this, they will likely want to do an appraisal of your home to determine its value and then come back with a final offer.\n\nCompleting the steps described above and receiving a final offer typically takes between two and six weeks. The average processing time for HELOCs, from application to underwriter final decision, was 21 days in 2019, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The process can be shorter or longer depending on your situation. The last step is for you to visit the office to sign the paperwork, and then, after about a three-day waiting period, you can access your funds through online transfers or issued checks.\n\nGetting a HELOC also comes with closing costs, in most cases of around 2-5% of the total loan amount, but it varies greatly depending on the lender. The closing cost can include application/origination fee, appraisal fee, title and escrow fees and fees for notaries and attorneys, among others.\n\nSome lenders can get you through the process of getting a HELOC faster. Applying for a HELOC Card, rather than a traditional HELOC can help you speed things along, and it may also come with fewer fees.

If so, it’s time to shop around for the best interest rate, which can vary from lender to lender. Keep reading to learn how HELOC interest rates are determined and what external factors affect them.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nInterest rates on HELOCs are determined by the prime lending rate plus a margin set by the lender. The prime rate is the lowest interest rate at which money can be borrowed, and is based on the federal funds rate, which is the overnight rate banks use to lend to one another.\nThe federal funds rate is set by members of the Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States. When the Fed adjusts the federal funds rate, based on current economic conditions, the prime rate moves in accordance and affects HELOC rates.\nThe margin set by the bank depends on your personal financial situation, including your credit score and Combined Loan-to-Value ratio (CLTV). The higher your credit score and lower your CLTV, the lower your margin will typically be.\n\nUnlike the interest rate on mortgages or home equity loans, HELOC rates are adjustable rather than fixed. That means the rate will move up or down overtime based on the benchmark index it is tied to.\n\nHELOC rates are based on two factors: A benchmark rate and your personal financial situation. Interest rates vary by lender, so make sure to do your research and shop around for the best rates before settling on a lender.\n\nWhat is the benchmark rate?\n\nGenerally, lenders set HELOC rates based on the prime lending rate, which is the lowest interest rate at which banks will lend money to their most creditworthy clients, typically large corporations. While the prime rate varies from lender to lender, the one published daily by the Wall Street Journal is the most commonly used.\n\nSo, how is the prime rate determined? It is largely influenced by the federal funds rate, which is the overnight rate banks use to lend to one another. The federal funds rate is set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is composed of 12 members of the Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States. When the FOMC raises the federal funds rate, the prime rate moves with it, which also affects your HELOC rate.\n\nThe FOMC meets eight times a year to review current economic and financial conditions, and decide whether or not to adjust the federal funds rate and, if so, in which direction. If the committee decides to increase the rate several times in a row, your HELOC rate will increase significantly along with it. For that reason, it’s important to check what the maximum interest rate is for your line of credit before settling on a HELOC from any lender.\n\nWhat is the markup or margin?\n\nThe primary factor banks use to determine the markup is your credit score. The higher your credit score, the lower the added margin and, therefore, the lower your HELOC rate will be. However, your Combined Loan-to-Value ratio (CLTV) also matters. The CLTV is the ratio of all secured loans against your property to its value. The lower your CLTV, the lower your rate will typically be.\n\nThe second factor influencing your HELOC rate is your personal financial situation, which determines the markup percentage, or margin, that your lender will add on top of the benchmark rate. For example, if the prime rate is 3.25% and your markup is 2%, your HELOC rate would be 5.25%.\n\nThe amount of money you want to borrow and the duration of your HELOC can also affect your markup. Lower amounts can lead to lower rates, as can shorter drawing and repayment periods.\n\nHELOC rate discounts\n\nOccasionally, you may see offers such as \"prime+0%,\" or even negative markup offers like \"prime-1%.\" This is typically an introductory rate, or limited-time offer, meaning your markup will increase after the discount period agreed upon by the lender. Before settling on an offer, make sure to check what the rate will be after this introductory offer ends, or you may be in for a hefty unexpected increase.\n\nFixed-rate option\n\nSome lenders may allow you to convert part, or all, of what you've borrowed into a fixed interest rate during the closing or draw period. This may come with certain limitations, such as a time limit or minimum withdrawal limit. Make sure to talk to your lender about the opportunity of switching between adjustable and fixed interest rates.\n\nAre you considering a HELOC but worried about increasing rates?

If you have opted only to pay interest during the draw period, you may be shocked at the new, higher monthly payments of interest and principal that are now required, and you may wonder, can a HELOC be refinanced? It is possible to refinance a HELOC. If you are thinking about it, you have a few options to choose from, and you may be able to keep your HELOC.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThere are a few ways that a HELOC can be refinanced and payments decreased. Your options are to request a loan modification to your current HELOC, get a new HELOC, refinance your HELOC and mortgage into a new first mortgage, or get a home equity loan to pay off your HELOC.\nYou may want to refinance your HELOC if you're having a hard time making the monthly payments and want better loan terms. Refinancing could also help you lock in a low fixed interest rate. Another reason to refinance is that you may need more time and funds to make further home improvements.\nEach refinance option comes with its own set of pros and cons. Carefully consider each option and your situation before deciding which alternative suits your needs the best.\n\nReasons to Refinance a HELOC\n\nA HELOC is a type of revolving credit line backed by the equity you have in your home, which means your property is used as collateral and secures the line of credit. HELOCs are divided into two phases: the draw period, during which you can borrow money from the credit line, repay, and borrow again, and the repayment period, during which you pay back any outstanding balance.\n\nDuring the draw period of your HELOC you are only required to pay interest on what you borrow. During the repayment period you can no longer withdraw funds, and you have to make monthly payments of principal and interest. If you've opted to pay only the interest during the draw period, you may be shocked at the increased monthly payments once you reach the repayment phase. Refinancing your HELOC may help make payments more affordable and could also allow you to take advantage of interest rates trending lower.\n\nAnother reason to refinance is that you may need more time and funds to make further home improvements. If your home's value has increased, you may be able to get more money from your home equity to complete the additional projects.\n\nWays to Refinance a HELOC\n\nThere are a few ways to refinance your HELOC. Consider your situation and your reason for refinancing, and make sure to check your options with several lenders before settling on a solution.\n\nAPPLY FOR A LOAN MODIFICATION\n\nThe first option when you're having difficulties making payments is to request a loan modification. Your lender may lower the interest rate or increase the repayment term to make your monthly payments more affordable and help you avoid defaulting.\n\nTo get your loan modification request approved, you will have to prove to your lender that you will be able to make payments under the new, negotiated terms. Keep in mind that not all lenders offer loan modifications.\n\nGET A NEW HELOC\n\nIf you want to buy time before entering the repayment phase, you may choose to open a new HELOC. This allows you to extend the draw period and its interest-only payment requirement and avoid principal payments for a while longer. This option may also be good if your home value has increased and you want to make a few more adjustments or improvements to your home and need more time and funds to do so.\n\nGetting a new HELOC and draw period may tempt you to borrow more, so make sure not to borrow beyond your means. Remember that you will eventually need to pay back your loan, and the longer you put it off, the higher your interest and your monthly payments will be. Also, keep in mind that because HELOC rates are adjustable, they may keep going up.\n\nREFINANCE YOUR MORTGAGE AND HELOC TOGETHER\n\nAnother option is to refinance your mortgage and HELOC together into a new first mortgage. This way, you may be able to secure a significantly lower interest rate. First mortgage rates are generally lower than both HELOC rates and home equity loan rates, as the first mortgage lender is first in line to profit if you were to default on payments and your house was to get foreclosed on.\n\nA new first mortgage usually has a fixed interest rate, making your monthly payments more predictable and plannable, but keep in mind that closing costs may be high.\n\nGET A HOME EQUITY LOAN TO PAY OFF YOUR HELOC\n\nYour fourth option is to get a home equity loan, also called a second mortgage, to pay off your HELOC. Since a home equity loan is paid out in a lump sum, you can use it to pay off your HELOC, and you won't be tempted to keep borrowing, as can happen with a revolving credit line. You will also get the stability of a fixed interest rate and steady monthly payments that don't change. The downside can be closing costs and fees and the fact that a long, drawn-out payment period can increase the total interest you will have to pay.\n\nAre you considering getting a HELOC?

In that case, it's essential to understand what HELOC interest rates are based on, what affects them, and how to find the lowest ones. This article will explain how you can secure the best HELOC rates.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nYour HELOC rate is based on two main factors: the prime rate used by banks and a margin determined by your financial situation and history.\nWhen determining your margin or markup, the lender will look at your credit score and CLTV, among other things.\nTo improve your chances of scoring a low HELOC interest rate, stay on top of your credit score and make sure you have enough home equity.\nKeep in mind that different lenders will offer different rates, so make sure you shop around and consider all your options to find the best rates.\n\nA quick look at how HELOC rates work\n\nThe typical HELOC has an adjustable interest rate, which means it can rise and fall over the loan term. There are two main factors that determine the interest on your credit line – the prime rate used by your lender, which is variable, and a margin determined by your financial situation and history, which remains constant.\n\nThe prime rate, which is the interest commercial banks charge their biggest, most creditworthy clients, is largely dependent on the federal funds rate set by the monetary-policy setting committee at the Federal Reserve. So when the Fed decides to raise or lower the federal funds rate, your bank’s benchmark prime rate follows in the same direction, and so does your HELOC rate.\n\nAs for the margin, your lender will look at your payment history, CLTV (Combined Loan-to-Value ratio), and FICO credit score because they want to make sure that you will be able to keep up with payments when the time comes to repay what you've borrowed. Therefore, the riskier the lender finds it to lend you money, the higher the rates you will get. Lenders often look for a credit score of at least 620 and a CLTV under 80%, although this will vary by lender.\n\nThe amount of money you want to borrow and the duration of your HELOC can affect your rates as well. You can learn more about what HELOC rates are based upon in this article.\n\nHow do I secure the lowest rate?\n\nNow that you know how HELOC rates generally work let's look at some strategies for securing a low rate.\n\nSHOP AROUND AND COMPARE\n\nWhen trying to find the best HELOC rate, the first thing you need to do is check with several lenders and compare what they offer. Rates can vary greatly depending on the lender, so make sure to consider all your options. Look at big national banks, smaller local banks, credit unions, and online lenders to find the best one. Keep in mind that you need to look at more than the initial rate to get a good sense of the most beneficial offer. Check how long the initial rate will last, what will happen after it expires, and the maximum rate. Also, look up any closing costs, balloon payments, inactivity fees, annual fees, and other hidden fees. Consider all these factors when comparing lenders. Keep in mind that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some lenders have halted HELOC applications, and others have significantly raised their requirements.\n\nAnother crucial step to securing a low HELOC rate is making sure your FICO credit score is the best it can be. Whether your score is excellent or below average can significantly affect the margin your lender will add on top of the prime rate, so before applying for a HELOC, you will want to do what you can to maintain good credit. Check that you don't have any old debt weighing your score down, and make sure to make payments on time. Accounts being sent to collections and late payments affect your score; the later, the worse. Don't take on any new debt right before your HELOC application, as this can negatively affect your credit as well. Also, don't close any old credit accounts right before applying, even if they are fully paid off, since this would reduce the total amount of revolving credit available to you. If your credit utilization ratio, or the total debt you're carrying divided by the total credit available to you, increases, it may negatively impact your credit score.\n\nHAVE ENOUGH HOME EQUITY\n\nMake sure you have enough equity in your home before applying if you want your rate to be as low as possible. The more equity you have, the less risky you will look to lenders. High equity means a low CLTV or Combined Loan-to-Value ratio. Your CLTV is calculated by adding up your loan balances and dividing by the appraised value of your home. Many lenders want you to have around 20% equity and a CLTV of under 80%. However, it varies, and some may accept as low as 10-15% equity. If you have very little equity, you may want to consider waiting and trying to pay off a bit more of your mortgage before applying for a HELOC.\n\nConsider an alternative\n\nOne alternative to a traditional HELOC is a HELOC Card. A HELOC Card works just like any other credit card on the market and allows you to access funds immediately to pay for items and services when you need them. However, unlike other credit cards, it is backed by your home equity, just like a HELOC loan. This can lead to significantly lower interest rates compared to other credit cards.\n\nIf you are looking for a more affordable alternative to a HELOC, a HELOC Card could be beneficial as it may come with significantly lower fees. For example, you could be avoiding closing costs, appraisal fees, annual fees, and inactivity fees. Also, if you use your HELOC Card to pay for home improvements, the interest on your HELOC Card may be tax-deductible.\n\nThe Aven HELOC Card is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back. Aven is the world's first home equity backed credit card and combines the low interest rates of a home equity line of credit with the flexibility of a credit card.

As with all loans, this type of transaction isn’t free and it’s important to shop around for a competitive interest rate. But you may be wondering: Are HELOC rates fixed or variable? Well, they can be both. Let us explain.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe interest rate on a HELOC is generally variable, which means it moves up and down in accordance with the benchmark rate it is tied to.\nThe prime rate is the most commonly used benchmark rate for HELOCs. The prime rate is largely based on the federal funds rate, which is set by members of the Federal Reserve.\nSome lenders may provide an option to convert a variable rate to a fixed rate, which can help you budget and keep monthly payments stable for an agreed-upon term.\nConverting your HELOC to a fixed rate may come with fees or minimum withdrawal requirements, so check the conditions with your lender before deciding whether or not to convert.\n\nVariable-Rate HELOCs\n\nThe interest rate on a traditional HELOC is usually variable, meaning it won't necessarily be the same every month. To understand how and why HELOC rates vary, we first need to understand how the index rate works.\n\nVariable interest rates are tied to an index, or benchmark, rate and increase or decrease based on moves in that rate. The index most commonly used for HELOCs is the prime rate, which the big banks charge their most creditworthy clients, who are generally large corporations. The prime rate changes over time because it is based primarily on the federal funds rate, which is set by the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC meets eight times a year to decide whether to raise or lower the federal funds rate based on current economic conditions. When the FOMC decides to change its rate, it affects the prime rate and, in turn, your HELOC rate.\n\nIn addition to the prime rate, the lender adds a markup based on your credit score, combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) and payment history. Generally, the lower your CLTV ratio and higher your credit score, the better your rate will be.\n\nWhen shopping around for a HELOC, you may see offers like \"prime+0%\" or \"prime-1%\". These are introductory or limited-time offers, so your rate will go up after a predetermined amount of time. Also keep in mind that, even if your lender offers you a low initial rate, the FOMC could increase the prime rate several times in a row, leading to an increase in your HELOC rate.\n\nFixed-Rate Option\n\nSome lenders offer the option to convert all or part of your loan to a fixed interest rate, which means that your rate will stay the same for a determined term, no matter what direction the prime rate and federal funds rate moves. With a fixed rate, you can stabilize your monthly payments and avoid any uncertainty. Converting your HELOC can usually be done at closing or any time during the draw period.\n\nThe fixed-rate term could last anywhere from one to 30 years, depending on the lender. Some lenders only offer limited terms, or may require minimum withdrawals. You could also be asked to pay a small fee to convert your variable-rate HELOC to a fixed interest rate. The longer it takes to pay off your debt, the more interest you will pay in the long run.\n\nIt may be worth it to convert a variable-rate HELOC to a fixed rate if you think the prime rate will increase, or want more control over your monthly payments. However, if you choose to convert and the prime rate falls, you lose out on a lower rate. Ultimately, the decision depends on your personal situation and how comfortable you are with current economic conditions.\n\nAre you considering a HELOC, but worried about the variable interest rate rising? With the Aven HELOC Card, your rate will never exceed 18%, no matter how high the prime rate goes.

Keep reading to learn how HELOCs on rental properties work, how to get one and what it can be used for.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIt is possible to open a HELOC on a rental property, just like you can on your primary residence.\nHowever, not all lenders offer HELOCs on investment properties because, in the event of financial hardship, the owner is more likely to prioritize their primary home over a rental property.\nAs a result, qualifying for a HELOC on an investment property may be more challenging and requires a higher credit score than for a HELOC on your primary residence.\n\nHow Do HELOCs Work?\n\nA HELOC allows you to tap into the equity you’ve acquired in your home to help pay for home improvements and renovations. Mathematically, the amount is the current market value of the property minus the outstanding balance on the primary mortgage. A HELOC carries less risk for lenders than other types of loans because the home is used as collateral in the case of a default and, therefore, comes with competitive interest rates for the borrower.\n\nA HELOC is made up of two phases: A draw period that typically lasts five to 10 years and a repayment period that lasts between 10 and 20 years. During the draw period, you can use the line of credit to borrow cash, repay it, and borrow more, much like an ordinary credit card. You only have to pay back what you spend, plus interest. During the repayment phase, you can no longer withdraw funds and start paying down debt in the form of monthly principal and interest payments. To learn more about how HELOCs work, take a look at this article.\n\nIf you're a real estate investor, you may be wondering if it's possible to take out a HELOC on a rental property. The short answer is yes. However, there's a lot to consider before applying.\n\nHELOCs on an Investment Property\n\nA HELOC on an investment property functions in the exact same way as a HELOC on a personal property, but the process of acquiring one can prove much more challenging due to the increased risk for the lender.\n\nFINDING A LENDER\n\nNot all lenders offer HELOCs on rental properties because the risk of default is much higher than with personal properties. In the event of a financial hardship, the borrower is much more likely to prioritize paying the loan on their primary property before paying down debt on a secondary property, whether that’s in the form of a HELOC or mortgage. In the case of a foreclosure, the sale proceeds would first go toward paying off the mortgage before any other liens on the property, such as a HELOC.\n\nThe best way to find a lender that offers investment property HELOCs is to leverage your existing network of real estate investors who have already qualified for a HELOC. Online forums and real estate investing groups may also be helpful.\n\nREQUIREMENTS FOR RENTAL PROPERTY HELOCS\n\nDue to the increased risks discussed above, rental property HELOCs are more expensive and come with stricter requirements than for HELOCs on primary residences. The interest rate is typically higher and the borrower must shell out cash for an additional appraisal and title search fees, among other costs.\n\nTo qualify, you’ll need a FICO credit score of 720 or above, versus just 620 for a HELOC on a personal property. The lender will also consider your combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) and debt-to-income ratio (DTI), both of which will need to be low.\n\nUnlike a HELOC on a personal property, lenders oftentimes require the borrower to wait a full year after purchasing the rental property before being eligible for a HELOC so they can prove that they have trustworthy tenants that will make payments on time and provide sufficient cash flow. The lender may also require you to have a large cash reserve on hand that’s equivalent to 18 to 24 months of payments.\n\nWhat Can an Investment Property HELOC be Used For?\n\nA HELOC on an investment property can be used in the exact same way as a HELOC on a personal property. They are most commonly used to pay for renovations and improvements to the property, but can also be used to consolidate high-interest debt, purchase a new property, or anything else you'd like. However, experts advise that HELOCs be used for investments that will grow your wealth over time, rather than for purchases that will not, such as cars or vacation trips.\n\nCurrently Aven’s product is not available for rental or investment properties. Are you considering applying for a HELOC for your primary residence? With Aven's HELOC Card, you can get approved in as fast as 15 minutes and have the card in your hands in a few days.

It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.1\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\nFor Cash Outs and Balance Transfers, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.4\nWhat is my monthly payment?\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. See Payment Calculator.\nCan I get cash too?\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.1\nDoes this affect my credit score?\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\nAre there any fees?\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don’t make the minimum payment.1\nWhy is the rate variable?\nSimilar to other credit cards, the rate is variable. It will vary based on the FFTR-UL as published in the Wall Street Journal, outside Aven's control. As the FFTR-UL shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, loans. The FFTR-UL may change several times a year.1 For Cash Outs and Balance Transfers we offer fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your monthly payment for 5 or 10 years.4\nWhy not get a traditional home equity line of credit instead?\nHome equity lines of credit often come with high fees (usually over $1000), minimum advances, minimum credit limits (often at least $50,000), and take 4-6 weeks to close.3 With Aven, you can get your card in just a few days in the mail, you can use it any number of times for any amount under your limit, with no origination or annual fees. Best of all, you get cash back on your purchases.1\nWhat are the criteria to qualify for this credit card?\n1) Own and have equity in your home. 2) Have an income that can support your monthly bill – we don’t want you to get into debt that you can’t afford. 3) Meet certain credit criteria, including credit score, income, and property value requirements.\nCredit card in the front.

Aven is on a mission to provide consumers with the lowest cost and most convenient access to capital. Their first product - the Aven Home Card - allows homeowners to access their home equity in minutes, starting at $0 to get, with all the benefits of a traditional credit card. Since launching in California in 2022, the company has issued over $1.5 billion in credit lines for the Home Card, earning a 4.9 star rating on Trustpilot. The company has saved customers over $100 million in interest payments to date.\n\n\"We believe there's no reason for anyone who owns an asset and has good credit history to use unsecured credit. Full stop. Unsecured credit is expensive and unhealthy,” said Sadi Khan, co-founder and CEO of Aven. “With our asset-backed credit cards, we give consumers credit for what they own - saving them thousands of dollars without sacrificing convenience.”\n\nHomeowners have been drawn to Aven’s ease, efficiency and lower cost of accessing capital:\n\nSave 50% or more on monthly interest rates - with rates as low as 7.99% APR – the lowest APR of any credit card in the US1\nNo annual fee, no notarization/closing fee option available in every state that Aven operates in\n2% unlimited cashback\nCredit lines up to $250,000\nApproval in less than 5 minutes and closing in as fast as 15 minutes\nPay only for what you use and debt protection offered to protect against adverse events2\n\nLast year, Aven grew revenue ~3x and broadened its offering to include a free, mobile-first financial advisory tool, Aven Advisor, which has quickly amassed over 160,000 members. The growth investment will be used to offer Aven’s Home Card in all 50 states, scale Advisor, and expand into new categories including auto-backed cards, mortgage refinance, and more.\n\n“By using technology to drive efficiency, Aven has built a product that responsibly helps drive down the cost of capital by over 50% for most US homeowners who are using alternative credit cards,” said Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures.\n\nThe company is also announcing an advisory board - focused on helping the company scale while protecting the interests of its cardholders and offering insights on industry conditions and strategic opportunities. The Aven Advisory Board will be made up of four executives: Michael DeVito, former CEO of Freddie Mac; Tim Mayopoulos, former CEO of Fannie Mae; Jim Messina, former Deputy Chief of Staff to the White House under the Obama administration; and Kevin Warsh, former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n“I was blown away by the Aven team when I first met them several years ago. But I was initially skeptical that their core product would scale in the staid, calcified industry structure that has prevailed in the mortgage market for decades. The Aven team is proving the skeptics wrong in a big way. I am thrilled to be their partner,” said Kevin Warsh, Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.\n\nAven is currently available in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming with a goal of reaching all 50 states by 2025.\n\nFor more information visit www.aven.com.\n\nAbout Aven\n\nAven is the best credit card for smart homeowners. Backed by home equity, it offers the lowest rates, best rewards, highest lines, and most flexibility - starting at $0 to get, use, and cancel.
