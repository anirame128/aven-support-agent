Consult a tax advisor regarding the deductibility of interest and charges.\n\nQuestions?\nWhat is the Aven Home Card?\nAven is a credit card that lets you use your home equity to get really low rates.\nHow does it work?\nAven combines the convenience of a credit card with the savings of a home equity line of credit (HELOC). It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.1\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\nFor Cash Outs and Balance Transfers, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.4\nWhat is my monthly payment?\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. See Payment Calculator.\nCan I get cash too?\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.1\nDoes this affect my credit score?\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\nAre there any fees?\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don\u2019t make the minimum payment.1\nWhy is the rate variable?\nSimilar to other credit cards, the rate is variable. It will vary based on the FFTR-UL as published in the Wall Street Journal, outside Aven's control. As the FFTR-UL shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, loans. The FFTR-UL may change several times a year.1 For Cash Outs and Balance Transfers we offer fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your monthly payment for 5 or 10 years.4\nWhy not get a traditional home equity line of credit instead?\nHome equity lines of credit often come with high fees (usually over $1000), minimum advances, minimum credit limits (often at least $50,000), and take 4-6 weeks to close.3 With Aven, you can get your card in just a few days in the mail, you can use it any number of times for any amount under your limit, with no origination or annual fees. Best of all, you get cash back on your purchases.1\nWhat are the criteria to qualify for this credit card?\n1) Own and have equity in your home. 2) Have an income that can support your monthly bill \u2013 we don\u2019t want you to get into debt that you can\u2019t afford. 3) Meet certain credit criteria, including credit score, income, and property value requirements.\nCredit card in the front.

Look no further! In this comprehensive article, we'll examine two popular credit cards\u2014the Home Depot Credit Card and the Aven Home EquityCredit Card\u2014that cater to individuals like you, aiming to streamline their home improvement expenses or optimize their balance transfer strategies.\n\n\t\n\nHome Depot2\n\n\t\n\nAven\n\n\n\n\nCard Type\n\n\t\n\nStore Specific\n\n\t\n\nGeneral Purpose\n\n\n\n\nRewards\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\t\n\n2% Cashback1\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Fee\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\t\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\nAPR\n\n\t\n\n17.99% - 26.99\n\n\t\n\n7.99% - 14.99%1\n\n\n\n\nCredit Limit\n\n\t\n\nNot Specified\n\n\t\n\nUp to $250,000\n\n\n\n\nProcess\n\n\t\n\nLess stringent\n\n\t\n\nStricter criteria\n\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\t\n\nSpecial financing options, extended return windows\n\n\t\n\nLarge lines, low rates, option to cash out, cash back\n\n\n\t\n\nApply Now\n\n\t\n\nApply Now\n\nApply Now\n\nWhen it comes to revamping your living space or dealing with existing credit card debt, having the right credit card can be a game-changer. That's why we're here to break down the unique features, rewards, fees, and benefits of these two credit cards, empowering you to make an informed decision based on your specific needs and financial goals.\n\nCard Features and Rewards:\n\nThe Aven Home Equity Credit Card is a general-purpose credit card that can be used anywhere VISA is accepted. It offers cash back rewards on everyday purchases. These rewards can be redeemed for statement credits.\n\nOn the other hand, the Home Depot Credit Card offers various benefits such as special financing options and access to exclusive cardholder events. The card provides a range of promotional financing offers, including deferred interest and fixed monthly payments, depending on the purchase amount.\n\nAnnual Fees and Interest Rates:\n\nThe Aven Home Equity Credit Card has no annual fee or sign up fee. It has an extremely low interest rate, making it an attractive choice for those looking to save on interest charges.\n\nThe Home Depot Credit Card does not charge an annual fee. However, it's important to note that the card has a relatively high APR (Annual Percentage Rate), which can be significant if you carry a balance from month to month.\n\nCredit Limit and Approval Process:\n\nThe Home Depot Credit Card typically offers a lower credit limit compared to the Aven Home Equity Credit Card. This is because it is primarily designed for Home Depot purchases and not intended for extensive everyday use. The approval process for the Home Depot Credit Card may be less stringent, making it more accessible to a wider range of credit profiles.\n\nThe Aven Home Equity Credit Card, being a general-purpose credit card, generally offers higher credit limits. However, the approval process may involve stricter criteria, including credit history and income verification, to qualify for higher credit limits.\n\nConclusion:\n\nBoth the Home Depot Credit Card and the Aven Home Equity Credit Card have their own strengths and cater to different consumer needs. If you are a regular Home Depot shopper, the Home Depot Credit Card can provide you with attractive financing options. However, if you prefer a more versatile credit card with rewards on everyday spending and a wider range of perks, the Aven Home Equity Credit Card may be a better fit.\n\nConsider your spending habits, credit profile, and specific needs before making a decision. Ultimately, choosing the right credit card depends on your personal preferences, financial goals, and the benefits that align with your lifestyle.\n\nApply Now\n\nAVEN\n\nCard\n\nHow It Works\n\nTestimonials\n\nApp\n\nAbout Us\n\nCareers\n\nRESOURCES\n\nPress\n\nPrivacy\n\nTerms of Service\n\nPay It Forward\n\nLicenses\n\nDisclosures\n\n\u00a9 2025 Aven\n\nThe annual percentage rate (\u201cAPR\u201d) is the cost of credit as a yearly rate and does not include costs other than interest.

    "text": "Card\nHow It Works\nReviews\nSupport\nApp\nWho We Are\nSign In\nHome Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) Card: What is it?\nPUBLISHED MAY 21, 2021 | 5 MIN READ\n\nNow that you understand what a HELOC Card is, let\u2019s dive into how it works. This article also explains where you can use your card and how it differs from the credit cards in your wallet.\n\nHow to get a HELOC Card\n\nTo use a traditional HELOC, you typically need to transfer funds to a checking account before making purchases or use special checks issued to you by the lender. This process can be complicated, time-consuming and frustrating. Some lenders will instead give you a HELOC Card to use at your convenience so you can access your funds immediately.\n\nHowever, there are several requirements to be eligible to apply, including: proving you have a steady income, being listed on your home\u2019s title, having a certain credit score and possessing a valid ID. If you meet the requirements, the application process typically looks something like this:\n\nComplete the online application, which asks questions about yourself and your home\nVerify your income by providing pay stubs or a company verification letter\nMeet with a notary to sign required documents\nReceive your card within a few business days\nWhere can HELOC funds be used?\n\nOnce your card arrives in the mail, you can start making purchases with it right away. You can use your card at any merchant that accepts major credit cards, like Visa and MasterCard.\n\nExperts recommend using a HELOC Card for purchases that help increase wealth over the long run. For example, many homeowners tend to use their funds on home improvements or remodeling, which can significantly increase the property\u2019s value. You can also use the card to transfer balances from personal loans or other credit cards.\n\nWhile there are no restrictions on what products or services you can purchase with a HELOC Card, financial advisors typically advise against using your card on frivolous items or experiences, such as vacations or a new car, which are unlikely to increase your wealth. These types of purchases could even make it harder to pay off your HELOC balance in the future.\n\nHow to pay for charges made on a HELOC Card\n\nEvery month, you will receive a statement with your charges, much like you do with a traditional credit card. The monthly bill for a HELOC Card from Aven, for example, consists of 1% of the principal balance plus finance and interest charges on the average daily balance during your last billing cycle.\n\nIf you choose to pay only your minimum balance each month, it can take you a very long time to pay your balance back. You can choose to pay more than the minimum or to make payments more often than once a month if you'd like to pay down your debt sooner. If you can't pay your monthly bill on time, you will likely incur a late fee.\n\nHow is a HELOC Card different from a credit card?\n\nWhile a HELOC Card is used in a similar way as a regular credit card, they are not the same. The main difference is that a HELOC Card uses your home\u2019s equity to secure the loan, while a credit card doesn\u2019t require any collateral. Consequently, HELOC Cards have much lower interest rates than credit cards. However, unlike with a credit card, the rate is usually variable, meaning it moves up and down based on a benchmark rate.\n\nAre you looking for a HELOC Card? Aven is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back. Aven is the world's first home equity-backed credit card and combines the low interest rates of a home equity line of credit with the flexibility of a credit card.

If so, you have probably thought about getting a second mortgage in the form of a loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC). But did you know it is possible to access your funds instantly using a credit card? This article explains the concept of a HELOC Card, how it\u2019s different from a traditional HELOC, as well as the benefits and disadvantages.\n\nWhat is a HELOC?\n\nLet\u2019s first explore what a HELOC is. With this type of loan you borrow funds against the equity you\u2019ve built in your home: the value minus the outstanding balance on the primary mortgage. You can use the funds whenever you need cash, and you do not pay interest on unused funds. Because your house is used as collateral in exchange for funds, HELOCs typically come with competitive interest rates versus other types of loans. However, HELOC interest rates are generally variable, meaning they move up or down based on a benchmark rate, like the federal funds rate. For that reason, it\u2019s important to consider the maximum rate for your HELOC when deciding whether or not to open one.\n\nThere are two phases of a HELOC: The draw period, which typically lasts five to 10 years, and the repayment period, which usually lasts 10 to 20 years. During the draw period, you can use the line of credit much like an ordinary credit card: borrow cash, repay debt, and borrow more cash. You\u2019re only required to pay for what you spend, plus interest. During the repayment phase, borrowing stops and the focus shifts to paying down debt in the form of monthly principal and interest payments.\n\nWhat can a HELOC be used for?\n\nHELOCs are oftentimes used to pay for home improvements and remodeling, which can help increase the value of the home. In addition, the interest on a HELOC may be tax-deductible if used to purchase, build or make significant improvements to a home.\n\nHowever, there are risks to consider. Because the interest rate is variable, an increase could make it more difficult to keep up with monthly payments and, consequently, increase the risk of foreclosure.\n\nWhat is a HELOC Card?\n\nNow that you understand what a HELOC is, let's talk about HELOC Cards. A HELOC Card allows you to access funds immediately to pay for items and services when you need them. This card acts just like a credit card and can be used anywhere credit cards are accepted, but typically has a much lower interest rate because it is secured by your home equity. HELOC cards can also be used to transfer balances from other credit cards and personal loans.\n\nBenefits of HELOC Cards\n\nThere are several benefits to a HELOC Card. You can use it anytime, anywhere, just like any other credit card, and get instant access to your line of credit. The interest rate on your card is usually lower than other credit cards because it uses your home as collateral. If you use your HELOC Card to pay for home improvements, the interest on your HELOC Card may be tax-deductible, and you never pay interest on unused funds.\n\nCompared with a regular HELOC, a HELOC Card may have significantly lower fees, and you may be avoiding the high credit minimums that ordinary HELOCs require. It can also be much faster to receive a HELOC Card than to get a traditional HELOC.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nA HELOC is a line of credit backed by your home equity. This type of loan is typically suitable for purchases that help build wealth, such as home improvements or remodelings, but can also be used for other purposes, such as paying off high-interest credit card debt or personal loans.\nHELOCs commonly have low interest rates, though they\u2019re variable and move up or down based on a benchmark rate.\nA HELOC Card allows you to access your funds immediately when you need them and works just like any other credit card. It may be faster to acquire than a traditional HELOC and may also incur significantly lower fees.\n\nAre you looking for a HELOC Card? Aven is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back.

But what is home equity, what can you do with it and how do you tap into it? Keep reading to find out.\n\nWhat is Home Equity?\n\nHome equity is the portion of your home that you have already paid off. It is calculated by subtracting your outstanding mortgage and loan balances from the current market value of your home. For example, if you put 20% down on a house that is worth $200,000 and take out a mortgage to cover the remaining $160,000, then you would have $40,000 of equity in your home. As you pay off the mortgage, your home equity increases until you own your home in its entirety.\n\nHow can I use my Home Equity to access funds?\n\nWhen you have home equity, you can use that equity as collateral to borrow money in the form of a home equity loan, home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a reverse mortgage. Interest rates on these types of loans tend to be lower than on other types of loans because they are secured by the portion of your home that you own. Choosing an option depends on what you wish to do with the extra cash.\n\nHOME EQUITY LOAN\n\nA Home Equity Loan, otherwise known as a second mortgage, is one way to borrow against your home equity and receive all the money in one lump sum at a fixed interest rate. You then make monthly principal and interest payments to pay it off. This type of loan can be useful if you need cash to make a large, one-time payment. A home renovation is a good example. It could also be used to consolidate high-interest debt.\n\nHOME EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT (HELOC)\n\nAnother option is a home equity line of credit or HELOC. A HELOC also uses your home equity as collateral. However, rather than receiving all your money at once, you get access to a line of credit from which you can withdraw money as you need it. The beauty of a HELOC is that you only pay interest on what you use.\n\nThere are two stages of a HELOC. The first is the draw period, during which you can withdraw as much money as you need up to the credit limit. The second is the repayment period, which is when you pay off the debt. Interest rates on HELOCs are usually adjustable, and your monthly payments will vary. A HELOC is a good option if you want to make many smaller improvements to your home over an extended period of time, or if you're not exactly sure how much money you will need.\n\nREVERSE MORTGAGE\n\nLastly, if you are at least 62 years old, a reverse mortgage is another choice to consider. As the name suggests, a reverse mortgage is the opposite of a traditional mortgage. Instead of making payments to a lender to earn equity in your home, the lender makes payments to you. Your debt to the lender increases, and your equity decreases as the lender buys it from you. You remain the title holder of your home, but when you sell it, pass away, or move out for more than a year, the loan becomes due. The lender will then sell the house to recover the funds you borrowed, and any remaining equity falls to you or your heirs.\n\nReverse mortgages are most commonly used by elderly adults since you need to be at least 62 years old to apply for one. They can be a good alternative when you want to retire but don't have enough savings and assets to do so. If you are considering a reverse mortgage, make sure to do your research, read the fine print and consult an attorney because scams are common.\n\nWhat is a Home Equity Line of Credit Card?\n\nWhile there are advantages to each of the options mentioned above, the application and approval process can take a few weeks, and getting access to your funds can be a hassle. Perhaps the easiest and fastest way to access your funds is with a HELOC Card, which is similar to a traditional HELOC, but without the need for a checkbook or online transfers. A HELOC Card works just like a credit card and can be used anywhere credit cards are accepted. There are lenders, like Aven, that specialize in these cards and in speeding up the approval process.\n\nTo apply for a HELOC Card, you will need to meet a few requirements like having a stable income, a credit score of around 650 and around 20% equity in your home. Unlike with a traditional HELOC, the entire process can be completed online and doesn\u2019t usually require a home appraisal. All you need to do is answer a few questions about yourself and your home, confirm your income by uploading pay stubs or logging into your bank account and complete an online notarization session to sign paperwork. To learn more about the requirements and steps to getting a HELOC Card as quickly as possible, check out this article.\n\nWhich option is right for me?\n\nDeciding which option is best depends on many factors, including what you need the money for and how quickly you need access to it. A home equity loan may be best for well-thought out projects with a known cost, while a HELOC is better for ongoing projects in which the costs are variable. However, if you need your funds quickly and want a convenient way to access them, a HELOC Card may be what you're looking for.\n\nHave you decided a HELOC Card is worth looking into?

But how do you apply, and what is the fastest way to get approved and get access to those funds?\n\nGetting a HELOC the Traditional Way\n\nTo qualify for a traditional HELOC, you will need to meet a few requirements in regards to your income, credit and percentage of equity in your home. The exact requirements vary by lender, but let's take a look at the most common conditions.\n\nThe first and, arguably, most important metric lenders look at when you apply for a HELOC is your credit score. Most lenders require a FICO\u00ae score of at least 620 to qualify for a HELOC, but the minimum could be set as high as 680. Some will approve you with a score under 620 if you have a low debt-to-income ratio or a high percentage of equity in your home.\n\nAs mentioned above, your debt-to-income ratio also matters. This ratio tells a lender whether or not you can afford to make payments on your line of credit, and is calculated by totaling your monthly debt payments, as well as other financial obligations, and dividing that number by your total monthly income. The resulting percentage is your debt-to-income ratio. Most lenders abide by guidelines set by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which recommends a debt-to-income ratio below 43%. Regardless, the lower this percentage, the easier it will be to qualify for a HELOC. Lenders will also evaluate your payment history on other loans to ensure you make payments on time and determine how risky it will be to lend you money.\n\nYou will also need to prove that you have a steady income so that lenders can be confident you\u2019ll pay back your line of credit. Typically, providing pay stubs or your most recent W-2 is sufficient.\n\nNext, you need to have enough equity in your home. Lenders usually look for at least 15 to 20 percent of equity compared to your home\u2019s value. To determine your equity, subtract the amount you owe on your mortgage from the current value of your home. For example, if you owe $200,000 on your mortgage and your home is valued at $350,000, your home equity is $150,000 (or 43%).\n\nOnce the lender has received and evaluated the above information, you\u2019ll receive an initial decision within a few days. However, rather than taking your word for it, many lenders will perform a home appraisal of their own to confirm the equity amount. This process involves a professional visiting your property to assess its value based on location, age, recent home improvements, curb appeal, nearby attractions and the current housing market.\n\nThe above steps can take a few weeks to complete before you receive a final decision on whether or not you have qualified for a HELOC, and you will likely pay fees associated with the service. Then, once you get a green light from the lender, you\u2019ll need to visit the office to sign paperwork and then wait about three days before accessing your funds through online transfer or issued checks. The entire process can take a month or longer, and typically involves closing costs of 2% to 5% of the loan amount, as well as fees for origination, appraisal, inactivity and early termination.\n\nGetting a HELOC Card\n\nDon\u2019t have a month to wait? A HELOC Card might be a better option. A HELOC Card is backed by your home\u2019s equity, just like a traditional HELOC, but it can take as little as 15 minutes to qualify. To apply, you will still need a credit score in the mid-600s, depending on your equity and debt-to-income ratio, proof of a steady income and enough equity in your home.\n\nHowever, you may be allowed to skip the home appraisal (eliminating any appraisal fees) and sign the closing documents via an online notarization session, which substantially shortens the approval process. The card typically arrives in the mail within 5-10 days, and after the three-day waiting period, you can use it anywhere credit cards are accepted.\n\nA HELOC Card also has significantly lower fees than a traditional HELOC. Skipping the appraisal means you\u2019ll only incur charges for late payments, insufficient funds, and taking out cash.\n\nDeciding between a HELOC Card and traditional HELOC\n\nWhen considering whether a traditional HELOC or a HELOC Card is the right choice for you, keep the similarities and differences discussed above in mind. Some people may feel more comfortable signing papers in person or may want to give their favorite bank their business. If this sounds like you, a traditional HELOC may be the way to go. However, if you're looking for the fastest and most affordable way to make your home equity work for you, a HELOC Card may be the best option.\n\nAre you considering applying for a HELOC and looking for the fastest way to do it?

But what is it, what can it be used for and when is a HELOC a good idea?\n\nKey Takeaways\nA HELOC is a line of credit backed by your home equity and can be a good idea when you're looking for a way to free up cash for home improvements.\nThere are other options to consider, depending on your situation, and what you want to use the funds for.\nIf a HELOC sounds like a good idea, consider a HELOC Card for a more efficient way to access your funds.\nWhat is a HELOC?\n\nA HELOC, or Home Equity Line of Credit, is a type of loan that uses your home equity as collateral. If you own at least 20% of your home, you may be able to use that equity to secure a HELOC. A HELOC works like a credit card in the sense that you can use the money when and where you need it. However, interest rates on HELOCs tend to be more competitive because the loan is backed by your home equity. In addition, rates are adjustable and move up or down based on a benchmark rate, such as the federal funds rate. During the initial draw period, which typically lasts five to 10 years, you can pay off your debt and borrow again as much as you\u2019d like. You\u2019ll only pay interest on the amount you withdraw. Then comes the repayment period, during which you pay down your debt by making monthly principal and interest payments.\n\nWhat are the alternatives to a HELOC?\n\nBefore settling on a HELOC, you may want to consider other options. Depending on your situation, and what you want to use the funds for, another type of loan may suit your situation better. Let's take a look at some of the alternatives so that you can decide whether a HELOC is a good idea for you.\n\nHOME EQUITY LOAN\n\nA Home Equity Loan, also known as a Second Mortgage, is backed by your home equity, just like a HELOC. The main difference is that this loan is paid out as a lump sum, and once it\u2019s taken out, that\u2019s it. You can\u2019t access additional funds, and when the debt is repaid, the loan is closed. The interest rate for this type of loan is typically fixed. A Home Equity loan can be used to consolidate high-interest debt or to fund home renovations when you have a plan and already know more or less how much you will spend.\n\nCASH-OUT MORTGAGE REFINANCE\n\nA Cash-Out Mortgage Refinance may also be a good option if you're looking to make some home improvements. This type of loan replaces your existing mortgage with a loan for more money than you currently owe on your house, and the difference is paid out to you in cash. Your monthly mortgage payments will be higher as a result. Like the Home Equity Loan above, once you\u2019re finished originating the loan, it\u2019s done; you cannot draw additional funds like you would on a HELOC.\n\nREVERSE MORTGAGE\n\nIf you are older than 62, a Reverse Mortgage is another choice. As the name suggests, this type of loan works in the opposite way of a traditional mortgage: The lender makes payments to you in exchange for equity in your home, and your equity decreases as your debt increases. The loan balance doesn\u2019t become due until you sell the property or pass away. This type of loan can be a good alternative when you want to retire but don't have enough savings and assets to do so. Scams are common, so do your research and be careful.\n\nPERSONAL LOAN\n\nAnother option to look into is a Personal Loan, which could be unsecured or secured against something valuable - like a car, for example. Personal Loans are often used to consolidate credit card debt or other high-interest debt, but keep in mind that the interest rates for personal loans can also be high compared with a HELOC.\n\nAdvantages of a HELOC\n\nThere are a few advantages of choosing a HELOC over the types of loans described above. First, the interest rates are usually lower than for other kinds of loans. Secondly, some lenders offer low or no closing cost and some may not charge fees for withdrawing cash. Finally, if you use your funds for home improvements or renovations, the interest on your HELOC may be tax-deductible.\n\nWhen is a HELOC a Good Idea?\n\nA HELOC may be the best choice if you are looking to use the funds for home improvements or renovations, which will increase the value of your home. It\u2019s an especially good option if you\u2019re unsure how much money you will need for the project because you\u2019re able to withdraw funds as you go, while only paying interest on what you use. On the other hand, if you\u2019re looking to free up cash for something like a car, which will not increase your wealth, another type of loan may be less risky. As discussed, a HELOC is backed by your home equity, which puts your home at risk should you not be able to pay back your debt.\n\nWhat is a HELOC Card?\n\nIf you've determined a HELOC is a good idea for you, consider getting a HELOC Card. It can take weeks to receive approval for a traditional HELOC, while a HELOC Card takes as little as 15 minutes and allows you to skip the home appraisal process. Once approved, the card arrives in the mail in a few days. After a three-day waiting period, you'll be free to use the card anywhere credit cards are accepted. With a traditional HELOC, you will usually need to use a special checkbook or online transfers to access your funds.\n\nDoes a HELOC seem like a good idea?

A Beginner\u2019s Guide\nPUBLISHED JUL 21, 2021 | 3 MIN READ\n\nThere are many options to consider when you need to free up cash for a project or purchase, such as credit card cash advances, personal loans, reverse mortgages and home equity loans. But have you ever considered a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), which allows you to tap into your home equity to fund home improvements or renovations? If you haven\u2019t, read on to discover how a HELOC works and why it may be a good option for you.\n\nKey Takeaways\nA HELOC is a line of credit that is backed by the equity you have in your home, meaning your house is used as collateral to secure the loan.\nA HELOC is recommended for investments that will increase your wealth, such as home improvements. It's not recommended for day-to-day living expenses or expensive purchases like cars or vacations.\nHELOC rates are determined using a baseline rate, typically the prime rate, and your credit profile. Typically, the higher your credit score, the lower the rate.\nHELOC rates are variable, meaning they move up or down in accordance with the benchmark rate. Remember to check your HELOC's maximum rate when applying to avoid a costly surprise.\nWhat is a HELOC?\n\nA HELOC is a line of credit backed by the equity you have in your home: the value of your home minus what you owe on your mortgage. A HELOC uses your home equity as collateral and lets you borrow against it.\n\nFor example, let's say you make a down payment of 20% on a house worth $200,000 and take out a mortgage to cover the rest. That means you initially have $40,000 worth of equity in your home, which increases as you make monthly payments on your mortgage. If you have at least 20% equity in your home (and meet a few other requirements - read more here), you may qualify for a HELOC.\n\nA HELOC consists of two phases. The first is the draw period, which usually lasts five to 10 years, and the repayment period, which can last 10 to 20 years. During the draw period, you are free to use your line of credit at your discretion, up to your limit. It functions much like a credit card: borrow cash, repay it and borrow again. You also only pay interest on what you use. When the draw period is over, the repayment phase begins. This is where you make monthly principal and interest payments to pay back what you've borrowed during the draw phase.\n\nHow are HELOC rates determined?\n\nHELOC interest rates are determined based on a benchmark interest rate, typically the prime rate, as well as your credit profile. Depending on your credit score, the lender will add a markup to the benchmark rate. Typically, the lower your credit score, the higher the interest you\u2019ll have to pay. If you have an excellent credit history, your rate could be as low as 3%, while if your credit is below average, it could be as high as 9-10%.\n\nBecause HELOCs are secured by home equity, the interest rates tend to be lower than with other types of loans. However, they are variable, meaning your rate will move up and down over time with the benchmark rate it is tied to. This means your monthly payments may increase, making it harder to keep up with payments. It is critical to consider this and check the maximum rate for your HELOC when deciding if it\u2019s the right choice for you.\n\nHow do homeowners benefit from HELOCs?\n\nThe biggest benefit of a HELOC is the ability to withdraw funds as you go and only pay interest on what you use, unlike other loans that require you to take out a lump sum and pay interest on the entire balance from the get-go. In addition, if the HELOC funds are used to pay for home improvement projects and renovations, which boost the value of the property over time, the interest may be tax-deductible. To learn more, read here about when a HELOC may (or may not) be a good idea.\n\nHow do lenders benefit from offering HELOCs?\n\nFor lenders, HELOCs offer protection if things go downhill because the borrower\u2019s property serves as collateral. If a borrower defaults on payments, the bank could ultimately take ownership of the home and sell it to pay off the loan. For this reason, it's best not to use the funds to pay for vacations, cars, groceries, or anything that will make it more difficult to pay off your monthly principal and interest payments.\n\nAre you considering applying for a HELOC?

When trying to decide what kind of loan is best suited to you and your situation, it's essential to know the differences between the two and the benefits and drawbacks of each. This article will explain how each type of loan works and explore what the key similarities and differences are.\n\nKey Takeaways\nMortgages and HELOCs are two types of loans that both use your property as collateral. This means that if you end up defaulting on your payments, you can end up losing your home.\nA mortgage is a fixed amount used to purchase property, while a HELOC is a revolving line of credit typically tapped for home improvements or renovations after a home is already bought.\nA mortgage can have a fixed or variable interest rate. Most HELOCs have variable interest rates.\nMortgages and HELOCs share a lot of the same requirements for eligibility, such as a good credit score, Debt-to-Income Ratio at 43% or lower, and a steady income.\nGetting a HELOC is usually quicker than getting a mortgage. However, the timeline varies a lot and depends on your lender and location, among other things.\nHow Does a Mortgage Work?\n\nA mortgage is a loan used to purchase property when you don\u2019t wish to buy it outright using cash. Instead of paying the whole amount that the home is worth upfront, you make a down payment (the general rule of thumb is at least 20% of the total price), and get a mortgage to cover the rest. The home you are buying serves as collateral for the loan. The mortgage, which includes a principal amount and interest, is paid back in monthly installments over a determined period of time. Once you've paid off the whole amount you owe, you will own the property in its entirety. Mortgage rates can be either adjustable or fixed.\n\nTo be eligible for a mortgage, you need to meet certain requirements. The lender will typically run a credit check, and the higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate and mortgage payment will generally be. For a conventional mortgage, a score of 620 or higher is often required.\n\nYou will need to prove to the lender that you have a steady income. This can be done by showing proof of employment, pay stubs, tax returns, and other documents. The lender also looks at your mortgage reserves \u2013 cash or any assets you have that can be easily converted into cash if you were to find yourself facing financial hardship and struggling to make payments. Investments in stocks, bonds, and funds, and money in checkings and savings accounts are some of the liquid assets that may be considered reserves.\n\nThe lender will also look at your DTI or Debt-to-Income Ratio. This is calculated by dividing your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) recommends a DTI of 43% or less.\n\nThe process of getting a mortgage begins with you applying to a mortgage lender. The lender will first verify if you meet the requirements and will be able to pay back the loan. If you are approved, they will come back with an offer of a loan at a specific interest rate to be repaid over a set amount of time. If you accept the lender's offer, you will go through a closing process, where you meet with the seller of the property to pay the down payment, have them sign over the property to you, and sign documents.\n\nFilling out the paperwork for the mortgage application won\u2019t take long, but getting approved, having the appraisal done, receiving a final offer and finalizing the closing procedure can be a lengthy process. After researching mortgages and finding a property you want to purchase (which can also take quite some time), you\u2019re looking at a timeline of approximately two months before you have the keys in your hand. According to Ellie Mae, a software company that processes mortgage applications, the average time to close purchase mortgage loans was 51 days in March 2021. Because there are so many steps in the process, however, there is no guaranteed timeline and the amount of time it takes to get a mortgage varies greatly.\n\nThe mortgage process also comes with a closing cost, which can include origination and appraisal fees, real estate commissions, taxes, insurance fees, title fees and more. The average closing cost is around 3-6% of the purchase price, but it varies depending on your mortgage lender, location and loan type.\n\nHow Does a HELOC Work?\n\nA Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is a type of loan that lets you borrow against home equity, typically to spend on repairs and improvements of the property. It uses your home as collateral, just like a mortgage. However, unlike a mortgage, a HELOC gives you access to a revolving line of credit from which you can borrow money, pay it back, and borrow again during the first phase of the loan called the draw period. During this time, you usually only pay interest on what funds you actually borrow. The draw period generally lasts five to 10 years and is followed by the repayment period, where you pay back your remaining balance through monthly payments of principal and interest. HELOC rates are typically adjustable and vary over time.\n\nTo be eligible for a HELOC, you need to meet a lot of the same requirements as for a mortgage, except for the mortgage reserves.\n\nJust like with a mortgage, the lender will look at your Debt-to-Income Ratio, which needs to be 43% or lower. You will also still need a credit score of around 620, depending on your DTI and the amount of equity you have in your home.\n\nThe home equity you own is the current price of your property minus any balance you owe on mortgages and loans against it, calculated as a percentage. To be eligible to apply for a HELOC, the minimum equity required is typically about 15-20%.\n\nHELOC lenders will also want to know that you can make payments and will therefore require you to prove employment and a steady income as well. Read more about the HELOC application process here.\n\nWhen you apply for a HELOC, the lender evaluates the above-mentioned information to determine if you are a good candidate for a line of credit. If you meet the requirements, the lender will give you an initial offer. Following this, they will likely want to do an appraisal of your home to determine its value and then come back with a final offer.\n\nCompleting the steps described above and receiving a final offer typically takes between two and six weeks. The average processing time for HELOCs, from application to underwriter final decision, was 21 days in 2019, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The process can be shorter or longer depending on your situation. The last step is for you to visit the office to sign the paperwork, and then, after about a three-day waiting period, you can access your funds through online transfers or issued checks.\n\nGetting a HELOC also comes with closing costs, in most cases of around 2-5% of the total loan amount, but it varies greatly depending on the lender. The closing cost can include application/origination fee, appraisal fee, title and escrow fees and fees for notaries and attorneys, among others.\n\nSome lenders can get you through the process of getting a HELOC faster. Applying for a HELOC Card, rather than a traditional HELOC can help you speed things along, and it may also come with fewer fees.

If so, it\u2019s time to shop around for the best interest rate, which can vary from lender to lender. Keep reading to learn how HELOC interest rates are determined and what external factors affect them.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nInterest rates on HELOCs are determined by the prime lending rate plus a margin set by the lender. The prime rate is the lowest interest rate at which money can be borrowed, and is based on the federal funds rate, which is the overnight rate banks use to lend to one another.\nThe federal funds rate is set by members of the Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States. When the Fed adjusts the federal funds rate, based on current economic conditions, the prime rate moves in accordance and affects HELOC rates.\nThe margin set by the bank depends on your personal financial situation, including your credit score and Combined Loan-to-Value ratio (CLTV). The higher your credit score and lower your CLTV, the lower your margin will typically be.\n\nUnlike the interest rate on mortgages or home equity loans, HELOC rates are adjustable rather than fixed. That means the rate will move up or down overtime based on the benchmark index it is tied to.\n\nHELOC rates are based on two factors: A benchmark rate and your personal financial situation. Interest rates vary by lender, so make sure to do your research and shop around for the best rates before settling on a lender.\n\nWhat is the benchmark rate?\n\nGenerally, lenders set HELOC rates based on the prime lending rate, which is the lowest interest rate at which banks will lend money to their most creditworthy clients, typically large corporations. While the prime rate varies from lender to lender, the one published daily by the Wall Street Journal is the most commonly used.\n\nSo, how is the prime rate determined? It is largely influenced by the federal funds rate, which is the overnight rate banks use to lend to one another. The federal funds rate is set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is composed of 12 members of the Federal Reserve, the central banking system of the United States. When the FOMC raises the federal funds rate, the prime rate moves with it, which also affects your HELOC rate.\n\nThe FOMC meets eight times a year to review current economic and financial conditions, and decide whether or not to adjust the federal funds rate and, if so, in which direction. If the committee decides to increase the rate several times in a row, your HELOC rate will increase significantly along with it. For that reason, it\u2019s important to check what the maximum interest rate is for your line of credit before settling on a HELOC from any lender.\n\nWhat is the markup or margin?\n\nThe primary factor banks use to determine the markup is your credit score. The higher your credit score, the lower the added margin and, therefore, the lower your HELOC rate will be. However, your Combined Loan-to-Value ratio (CLTV) also matters. The CLTV is the ratio of all secured loans against your property to its value. The lower your CLTV, the lower your rate will typically be.\n\nThe second factor influencing your HELOC rate is your personal financial situation, which determines the markup percentage, or margin, that your lender will add on top of the benchmark rate. For example, if the prime rate is 3.25% and your markup is 2%, your HELOC rate would be 5.25%.\n\nThe amount of money you want to borrow and the duration of your HELOC can also affect your markup. Lower amounts can lead to lower rates, as can shorter drawing and repayment periods.\n\nHELOC rate discounts\n\nOccasionally, you may see offers such as \"prime+0%,\" or even negative markup offers like \"prime-1%.\" This is typically an introductory rate, or limited-time offer, meaning your markup will increase after the discount period agreed upon by the lender. Before settling on an offer, make sure to check what the rate will be after this introductory offer ends, or you may be in for a hefty unexpected increase.\n\nFixed-rate option\n\nSome lenders may allow you to convert part, or all, of what you've borrowed into a fixed interest rate during the closing or draw period. This may come with certain limitations, such as a time limit or minimum withdrawal limit. Make sure to talk to your lender about the opportunity of switching between adjustable and fixed interest rates.\n\nAre you considering a HELOC but worried about increasing rates?

If you have opted only to pay interest during the draw period, you may be shocked at the new, higher monthly payments of interest and principal that are now required, and you may wonder, can a HELOC be refinanced? It is possible to refinance a HELOC. If you are thinking about it, you have a few options to choose from, and you may be able to keep your HELOC.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThere are a few ways that a HELOC can be refinanced and payments decreased. Your options are to request a loan modification to your current HELOC, get a new HELOC, refinance your HELOC and mortgage into a new first mortgage, or get a home equity loan to pay off your HELOC.\nYou may want to refinance your HELOC if you're having a hard time making the monthly payments and want better loan terms. Refinancing could also help you lock in a low fixed interest rate. Another reason to refinance is that you may need more time and funds to make further home improvements.\nEach refinance option comes with its own set of pros and cons. Carefully consider each option and your situation before deciding which alternative suits your needs the best.\n\nReasons to Refinance a HELOC\n\nA HELOC is a type of revolving credit line backed by the equity you have in your home, which means your property is used as collateral and secures the line of credit. HELOCs are divided into two phases: the draw period, during which you can borrow money from the credit line, repay, and borrow again, and the repayment period, during which you pay back any outstanding balance.\n\nDuring the draw period of your HELOC you are only required to pay interest on what you borrow. During the repayment period you can no longer withdraw funds, and you have to make monthly payments of principal and interest. If you've opted to pay only the interest during the draw period, you may be shocked at the increased monthly payments once you reach the repayment phase. Refinancing your HELOC may help make payments more affordable and could also allow you to take advantage of interest rates trending lower.\n\nAnother reason to refinance is that you may need more time and funds to make further home improvements. If your home's value has increased, you may be able to get more money from your home equity to complete the additional projects.\n\nWays to Refinance a HELOC\n\nThere are a few ways to refinance your HELOC. Consider your situation and your reason for refinancing, and make sure to check your options with several lenders before settling on a solution.\n\nAPPLY FOR A LOAN MODIFICATION\n\nThe first option when you're having difficulties making payments is to request a loan modification. Your lender may lower the interest rate or increase the repayment term to make your monthly payments more affordable and help you avoid defaulting.\n\nTo get your loan modification request approved, you will have to prove to your lender that you will be able to make payments under the new, negotiated terms. Keep in mind that not all lenders offer loan modifications.\n\nGET A NEW HELOC\n\nIf you want to buy time before entering the repayment phase, you may choose to open a new HELOC. This allows you to extend the draw period and its interest-only payment requirement and avoid principal payments for a while longer. This option may also be good if your home value has increased and you want to make a few more adjustments or improvements to your home and need more time and funds to do so.\n\nGetting a new HELOC and draw period may tempt you to borrow more, so make sure not to borrow beyond your means. Remember that you will eventually need to pay back your loan, and the longer you put it off, the higher your interest and your monthly payments will be. Also, keep in mind that because HELOC rates are adjustable, they may keep going up.\n\nREFINANCE YOUR MORTGAGE AND HELOC TOGETHER\n\nAnother option is to refinance your mortgage and HELOC together into a new first mortgage. This way, you may be able to secure a significantly lower interest rate. First mortgage rates are generally lower than both HELOC rates and home equity loan rates, as the first mortgage lender is first in line to profit if you were to default on payments and your house was to get foreclosed on.\n\nA new first mortgage usually has a fixed interest rate, making your monthly payments more predictable and plannable, but keep in mind that closing costs may be high.\n\nGET A HOME EQUITY LOAN TO PAY OFF YOUR HELOC\n\nYour fourth option is to get a home equity loan, also called a second mortgage, to pay off your HELOC. Since a home equity loan is paid out in a lump sum, you can use it to pay off your HELOC, and you won't be tempted to keep borrowing, as can happen with a revolving credit line. You will also get the stability of a fixed interest rate and steady monthly payments that don't change. The downside can be closing costs and fees and the fact that a long, drawn-out payment period can increase the total interest you will have to pay.\n\nAre you considering getting a HELOC?

In that case, it's essential to understand what HELOC interest rates are based on, what affects them, and how to find the lowest ones. This article will explain how you can secure the best HELOC rates.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nYour HELOC rate is based on two main factors: the prime rate used by banks and a margin determined by your financial situation and history.\nWhen determining your margin or markup, the lender will look at your credit score and CLTV, among other things.\nTo improve your chances of scoring a low HELOC interest rate, stay on top of your credit score and make sure you have enough home equity.\nKeep in mind that different lenders will offer different rates, so make sure you shop around and consider all your options to find the best rates.\n\nA quick look at how HELOC rates work\n\nThe typical HELOC has an adjustable interest rate, which means it can rise and fall over the loan term. There are two main factors that determine the interest on your credit line \u2013 the prime rate used by your lender, which is variable, and a margin determined by your financial situation and history, which remains constant.\n\nThe prime rate, which is the interest commercial banks charge their biggest, most creditworthy clients, is largely dependent on the federal funds rate set by the monetary-policy setting committee at the Federal Reserve. So when the Fed decides to raise or lower the federal funds rate, your bank\u2019s benchmark prime rate follows in the same direction, and so does your HELOC rate.\n\nAs for the margin, your lender will look at your payment history, CLTV (Combined Loan-to-Value ratio), and FICO credit score because they want to make sure that you will be able to keep up with payments when the time comes to repay what you've borrowed. Therefore, the riskier the lender finds it to lend you money, the higher the rates you will get. Lenders often look for a credit score of at least 620 and a CLTV under 80%, although this will vary by lender.\n\nThe amount of money you want to borrow and the duration of your HELOC can affect your rates as well. You can learn more about what HELOC rates are based upon in this article.\n\nHow do I secure the lowest rate?\n\nNow that you know how HELOC rates generally work let's look at some strategies for securing a low rate.\n\nSHOP AROUND AND COMPARE\n\nWhen trying to find the best HELOC rate, the first thing you need to do is check with several lenders and compare what they offer. Rates can vary greatly depending on the lender, so make sure to consider all your options. Look at big national banks, smaller local banks, credit unions, and online lenders to find the best one. Keep in mind that you need to look at more than the initial rate to get a good sense of the most beneficial offer. Check how long the initial rate will last, what will happen after it expires, and the maximum rate. Also, look up any closing costs, balloon payments, inactivity fees, annual fees, and other hidden fees. Consider all these factors when comparing lenders. Keep in mind that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some lenders have halted HELOC applications, and others have significantly raised their requirements.\n\nAnother crucial step to securing a low HELOC rate is making sure your FICO credit score is the best it can be. Whether your score is excellent or below average can significantly affect the margin your lender will add on top of the prime rate, so before applying for a HELOC, you will want to do what you can to maintain good credit. Check that you don't have any old debt weighing your score down, and make sure to make payments on time. Accounts being sent to collections and late payments affect your score; the later, the worse. Don't take on any new debt right before your HELOC application, as this can negatively affect your credit as well. Also, don't close any old credit accounts right before applying, even if they are fully paid off, since this would reduce the total amount of revolving credit available to you. If your credit utilization ratio, or the total debt you're carrying divided by the total credit available to you, increases, it may negatively impact your credit score.\n\nHAVE ENOUGH HOME EQUITY\n\nMake sure you have enough equity in your home before applying if you want your rate to be as low as possible. The more equity you have, the less risky you will look to lenders. High equity means a low CLTV or Combined Loan-to-Value ratio. Your CLTV is calculated by adding up your loan balances and dividing by the appraised value of your home. Many lenders want you to have around 20% equity and a CLTV of under 80%. However, it varies, and some may accept as low as 10-15% equity. If you have very little equity, you may want to consider waiting and trying to pay off a bit more of your mortgage before applying for a HELOC.\n\nConsider an alternative\n\nOne alternative to a traditional HELOC is a HELOC Card. A HELOC Card works just like any other credit card on the market and allows you to access funds immediately to pay for items and services when you need them. However, unlike other credit cards, it is backed by your home equity, just like a HELOC loan. This can lead to significantly lower interest rates compared to other credit cards.\n\nIf you are looking for a more affordable alternative to a HELOC, a HELOC Card could be beneficial as it may come with significantly lower fees. For example, you could be avoiding closing costs, appraisal fees, annual fees, and inactivity fees. Also, if you use your HELOC Card to pay for home improvements, the interest on your HELOC Card may be tax-deductible.\n\nThe Aven HELOC Card is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back.

As with all loans, this type of transaction isn\u2019t free and it\u2019s important to shop around for a competitive interest rate. But you may be wondering: Are HELOC rates fixed or variable? Well, they can be both. Let us explain.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nThe interest rate on a HELOC is generally variable, which means it moves up and down in accordance with the benchmark rate it is tied to.\nThe prime rate is the most commonly used benchmark rate for HELOCs. The prime rate is largely based on the federal funds rate, which is set by members of the Federal Reserve.\nSome lenders may provide an option to convert a variable rate to a fixed rate, which can help you budget and keep monthly payments stable for an agreed-upon term.\nConverting your HELOC to a fixed rate may come with fees or minimum withdrawal requirements, so check the conditions with your lender before deciding whether or not to convert.\n\nVariable-Rate HELOCs\n\nThe interest rate on a traditional HELOC is usually variable, meaning it won't necessarily be the same every month. To understand how and why HELOC rates vary, we first need to understand how the index rate works.\n\nVariable interest rates are tied to an index, or benchmark, rate and increase or decrease based on moves in that rate. The index most commonly used for HELOCs is the prime rate, which the big banks charge their most creditworthy clients, who are generally large corporations. The prime rate changes over time because it is based primarily on the federal funds rate, which is set by the Federal Reserve\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC meets eight times a year to decide whether to raise or lower the federal funds rate based on current economic conditions. When the FOMC decides to change its rate, it affects the prime rate and, in turn, your HELOC rate.\n\nIn addition to the prime rate, the lender adds a markup based on your credit score, combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) and payment history. Generally, the lower your CLTV ratio and higher your credit score, the better your rate will be.\n\nWhen shopping around for a HELOC, you may see offers like \"prime+0%\" or \"prime-1%\". These are introductory or limited-time offers, so your rate will go up after a predetermined amount of time. Also keep in mind that, even if your lender offers you a low initial rate, the FOMC could increase the prime rate several times in a row, leading to an increase in your HELOC rate.\n\nFixed-Rate Option\n\nSome lenders offer the option to convert all or part of your loan to a fixed interest rate, which means that your rate will stay the same for a determined term, no matter what direction the prime rate and federal funds rate moves. With a fixed rate, you can stabilize your monthly payments and avoid any uncertainty. Converting your HELOC can usually be done at closing or any time during the draw period.\n\nThe fixed-rate term could last anywhere from one to 30 years, depending on the lender. Some lenders only offer limited terms, or may require minimum withdrawals. You could also be asked to pay a small fee to convert your variable-rate HELOC to a fixed interest rate. The longer it takes to pay off your debt, the more interest you will pay in the long run.\n\nIt may be worth it to convert a variable-rate HELOC to a fixed rate if you think the prime rate will increase, or want more control over your monthly payments. However, if you choose to convert and the prime rate falls, you lose out on a lower rate. Ultimately, the decision depends on your personal situation and how comfortable you are with current economic conditions.\n\nAre you considering a HELOC, but worried about the variable interest rate rising? With the Aven HELOC Card, your rate will never exceed 18%, no matter how high the prime rate goes.

Keep reading to learn how HELOCs on rental properties work, how to get one and what it can be used for.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIt is possible to open a HELOC on a rental property, just like you can on your primary residence.\nHowever, not all lenders offer HELOCs on investment properties because, in the event of financial hardship, the owner is more likely to prioritize their primary home over a rental property.\nAs a result, qualifying for a HELOC on an investment property may be more challenging and requires a higher credit score than for a HELOC on your primary residence.\n\nHow Do HELOCs Work?\n\nA HELOC allows you to tap into the equity you\u2019ve acquired in your home to help pay for home improvements and renovations. Mathematically, the amount is the current market value of the property minus the outstanding balance on the primary mortgage. A HELOC carries less risk for lenders than other types of loans because the home is used as collateral in the case of a default and, therefore, comes with competitive interest rates for the borrower.\n\nA HELOC is made up of two phases: A draw period that typically lasts five to 10 years and a repayment period that lasts between 10 and 20 years. During the draw period, you can use the line of credit to borrow cash, repay it, and borrow more, much like an ordinary credit card. You only have to pay back what you spend, plus interest. During the repayment phase, you can no longer withdraw funds and start paying down debt in the form of monthly principal and interest payments. To learn more about how HELOCs work, take a look at this article.\n\nIf you're a real estate investor, you may be wondering if it's possible to take out a HELOC on a rental property. The short answer is yes. However, there's a lot to consider before applying.\n\nHELOCs on an Investment Property\n\nA HELOC on an investment property functions in the exact same way as a HELOC on a personal property, but the process of acquiring one can prove much more challenging due to the increased risk for the lender.\n\nFINDING A LENDER\n\nNot all lenders offer HELOCs on rental properties because the risk of default is much higher than with personal properties. In the event of a financial hardship, the borrower is much more likely to prioritize paying the loan on their primary property before paying down debt on a secondary property, whether that\u2019s in the form of a HELOC or mortgage. In the case of a foreclosure, the sale proceeds would first go toward paying off the mortgage before any other liens on the property, such as a HELOC.\n\nThe best way to find a lender that offers investment property HELOCs is to leverage your existing network of real estate investors who have already qualified for a HELOC. Online forums and real estate investing groups may also be helpful.\n\nREQUIREMENTS FOR RENTAL PROPERTY HELOCS\n\nDue to the increased risks discussed above, rental property HELOCs are more expensive and come with stricter requirements than for HELOCs on primary residences. The interest rate is typically higher and the borrower must shell out cash for an additional appraisal and title search fees, among other costs.\n\nTo qualify, you\u2019ll need a FICO credit score of 720 or above, versus just 620 for a HELOC on a personal property. The lender will also consider your combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) and debt-to-income ratio (DTI), both of which will need to be low.\n\nUnlike a HELOC on a personal property, lenders oftentimes require the borrower to wait a full year after purchasing the rental property before being eligible for a HELOC so they can prove that they have trustworthy tenants that will make payments on time and provide sufficient cash flow. The lender may also require you to have a large cash reserve on hand that\u2019s equivalent to 18 to 24 months of payments.\n\nWhat Can an Investment Property HELOC be Used For?\n\nA HELOC on an investment property can be used in the exact same way as a HELOC on a personal property. They are most commonly used to pay for renovations and improvements to the property, but can also be used to consolidate high-interest debt, purchase a new property, or anything else you'd like. However, experts advise that HELOCs be used for investments that will grow your wealth over time, rather than for purchases that will not, such as cars or vacation trips.\n\nCurrently Aven\u2019s product is not available for rental or investment properties. Are you considering applying for a HELOC for your primary residence? With Aven's HELOC Card, you can get approved in as fast as 15 minutes and have the card in your hands in a few days.

The APR is a variable rate based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate (\u201cIndex\u201d) published by the Wall Street Journal in its Money Rates section. The WSJ Prime Rate as of Jan 10th, 2025 EST is 7.50%. Your initial APR is based on a margin, determined by your creditworthiness when you open your account, plus the Index at the time of application. Your APR is subject to change as allowed by applicable law. Best rates available only to the highest-qualified borrowers. The maximum APR will not exceed 18% during the life of your account. Cash Out (draw to bank account) fee and Balance Transfer fee is 2.5% of amount transferred. This fee is subject to change. The county where your property is located may charge recording fees. If your line is greater than $25,000, you are responsible for paying these costs. These costs will be placed in a 12-month interest free, fixed term loan and be part of your Minimum Payment Due.\n\nYou are not required to sign up for AutoPay. To receive a 0.25 percentage point discount to your APR, you must enroll in AutoPay by the end of your first billing cycle and maintain AutoPay. This discount is available to new cardholders only. If you fail to enroll, or if you discontinue AutoPay, your APR will increase by 0.25 percentage points. We reserve the right to terminate or modify the AutoPay discount program at any time without notice. See AutoPay Terms & Conditions for details.\n\nCash back available for those who sign up for AutoPay. See Cash Back Terms & Conditions for details. Some restrictions apply.\n\nFor the initial cash out draw, you are charged a fee of 0% of the amount drawn. This fee is subject to change. There are no fees for subsequent cash outs or balance transfers. The APR for an Aven Simple Loan (the \u201cASL APR\u201d) is based on your variable APR and other factors at the time you agree to the plan. The ASL APR is fixed and will not change during the term of this plan and is subject to the applicable draw supplement.\n\nIf you have an active HELOC agreement or offer within the last 30 days that demonstrates a lower cost than ours, we\u2019ll beat the offer or send you $250.

It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.1\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\nFor Cash Outs and Balance Transfers, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.4\nWhat is my monthly payment?\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. See Payment Calculator.\nCan I get cash too?\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.1\nDoes this affect my credit score?\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\nAre there any fees?\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don\u2019t make the minimum payment.1\nWhy is the rate variable?\nSimilar to other credit cards, the rate is variable. It will vary based on the FFTR-UL as published in the Wall Street Journal, outside Aven's control. As the FFTR-UL shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, loans. The FFTR-UL may change several times a year.1 For Cash Outs and Balance Transfers we offer fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your monthly payment for 5 or 10 years.4\nWhy not get a traditional home equity line of credit instead?\nHome equity lines of credit often come with high fees (usually over $1000), minimum advances, minimum credit limits (often at least $50,000), and take 4-6 weeks to close.3 With Aven, you can get your card in just a few days in the mail, you can use it any number of times for any amount under your limit, with no origination or annual fees. Best of all, you get cash back on your purchases.1\nWhat are the criteria to qualify for this credit card?\n1) Own and have equity in your home. 2) Have an income that can support your monthly bill \u2013 we don\u2019t want you to get into debt that you can\u2019t afford. 3) Meet certain credit criteria, including credit score, income, and property value requirements.\nCredit card in the front.

Aven is on a mission to provide consumers with the lowest cost and most convenient access to capital. Their first product - the Aven Home Card - allows homeowners to access their home equity in minutes, starting at $0 to get, with all the benefits of a traditional credit card. Since launching in California in 2022, the company has issued over $1.5 billion in credit lines for the Home Card, earning a 4.9 star rating on Trustpilot. The company has saved customers over $100 million in interest payments to date.\n\n\"We believe there's no reason for anyone who owns an asset and has good credit history to use unsecured credit. Full stop. Unsecured credit is expensive and unhealthy,\u201d said Sadi Khan, co-founder and CEO of Aven. \u201cWith our asset-backed credit cards, we give consumers credit for what they own - saving them thousands of dollars without sacrificing convenience.\u201d\n\nHomeowners have been drawn to Aven\u2019s ease, efficiency and lower cost of accessing capital:\n\nSave 50% or more on monthly interest rates - with rates as low as 7.99% APR \u2013 the lowest APR of any credit card in the US1\nNo annual fee, no notarization/closing fee option available in every state that Aven operates in\n2% unlimited cashback\nCredit lines up to $250,000\nApproval in less than 5 minutes and closing in as fast as 15 minutes\nPay only for what you use and debt protection offered to protect against adverse events2\n\nLast year, Aven grew revenue ~3x and broadened its offering to include a free, mobile-first financial advisory tool, Aven Advisor, which has quickly amassed over 160,000 members. The growth investment will be used to offer Aven\u2019s Home Card in all 50 states, scale Advisor, and expand into new categories including auto-backed cards, mortgage refinance, and more.\n\n\u201cBy using technology to drive efficiency, Aven has built a product that responsibly helps drive down the cost of capital by over 50% for most US homeowners who are using alternative credit cards,\u201d said Vinod Khosla of Khosla Ventures.\n\nThe company is also announcing an advisory board - focused on helping the company scale while protecting the interests of its cardholders and offering insights on industry conditions and strategic opportunities. The Aven Advisory Board will be made up of four executives: Michael DeVito, former CEO of Freddie Mac; Tim Mayopoulos, former CEO of Fannie Mae; Jim Messina, former Deputy Chief of Staff to the White House under the Obama administration; and Kevin Warsh, former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n\n\u201cI was blown away by the Aven team when I first met them several years ago. But I was initially skeptical that their core product would scale in the staid, calcified industry structure that has prevailed in the mortgage market for decades. The Aven team is proving the skeptics wrong in a big way. I am thrilled to be their partner,\u201d said Kevin Warsh, Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.\n\nAven is currently available in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming with a goal of reaching all 50 states by 2025.\n\nFor more information visit www.aven.com.\n\nAbout Aven\n\nAven is the best credit card for smart homeowners.
