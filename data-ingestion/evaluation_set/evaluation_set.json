Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.Please note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current.",

These plans usually amortize over several years, and specific terms, including the exact monthly payment amount, should be detailed in the account agreement [1].\n\nUnfortunately, without specific details on your policy or loan terms, such as the interest rate or the specific fixed payment plan you might choose, I can't provide an exact monthly payment amount.

    "expected_answer": "Regarding your queries:\n\n1. **Borrowing More:** If you're looking to increase your credit line with Aven, the maximum line size currently offered is $250,000. The credit line size and interest rate are determined by their automated underwriting system, which is fully automated and calculates offers based on an applicant\u2019s income, equity, credit, and debt obligations [1].\n\n2. **Using a House as Collateral:** Aven is a home equity line of credit accessed through a credit card, meaning your home can indeed be used as collateral. However, note that Aven requires the property not to be listed for sale during the origination process [2]. Additionally, Aven places a lien on the home for the approved line size amount upon opening the account [3].\n\nIf you have further questions or need more detailed information, please refer to your account agreement or contact Aven directly.\n\nSources:\n[1] FAQ Document\n[2] FAQ Document\n[3] FAQ Document",
    "source": "aven.com/support",
    "agent_answer": "Yes, you can borrow more using a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) or a Home Equity Loan, both of which use your home as collateral. \n\n- **HELOC**: Allows you to borrow against your home equity as needed, similar to a credit card.\n- **Home Equity Loan**: Provides a lump sum based on your home equity.\n\nTo qualify, you typically need at least 20% equity in your home and meet certain eligibility criteria.

    "expected_answer": "It seems your question touches on a couple of aspects: the credit limit and monthly payment calculation.\n\n### Credit Limit:\nAven determines credit line and interest rates based on a fully automated underwriting system. This system calculates offers based on the applicant\u2019s income, equity, credit, and debt obligations [1]. Therefore, even if you own your home outright, your credit limit could still be influenced by factors such as income and overall credit profile.\n\n### Monthly Payment Calculation:\nFor fixed installment plans, Aven offers several options. The monthly payment is calculated so that the entire amount of the plan and the interest is paid by the end of the selected term [2]. To get precise estimates for your payments, you can use the Aven payment calculator available at their website [3].\n\nIf you need further assistance with your specific account details, these options and terms are typically outlined in your account agreement. You can check your account agreement for more precise options available to you according to your account setup [2].\n\nSources:\n[1] FAQ Document\n[2] FAQ Document\n[3] FAQ Document\n[4] FAQ Document",

    "question": "APR TOO HIGH",
    "expected_answer": "The concern about a high APR (Annual Percentage Rate) on your Aven account can be influenced by several factors. Here's an explanation based on the documents I reviewed:\n\n1. **Variable Rate**: Aven Cards have a variable rate that fluctuates based on an index (either the Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This means that your APR can shift up or down depending on changes in these indices [1].\n\n2. **Rate Caps**: While Aven cannot directly adjust the offer once given, there is a cap on the rates. For Aven Cards, the maximum APR is capped at 18% [2].\n\n3. **Offer and Terms**: Aven determines credit line size and interest based on an applicant's income, credit, equity, and debt obligations through a fully automated underwriting system. Unfortunately, this means that individual offers are determined algorithmically and cannot be adjusted by Aven after they are set [3].\n\n4. **Fixed Rate Options**: For some cardholders, Aven offers the opportunity to set up fixed payment and fixed rate Simple Loan plans [4].\n\nYou may want to review your specific account terms and check if you have the option to switch to a fixed rate plan if eligible, or contact Aven support for more information on your specific case.\n\nIf you need further help or adjustments on your account, contacting Aven directly through their support email or phone would be beneficial to explore your options.\n\nSources:\n[1] FAQ Document\n[2] FAQ Document\n[3] FAQ Document\n[4] FAQ Document",

The interest is calculated using an Average Daily Balance method, meaning it\u2019s the sum of the balances each day divided by the number of days in the cycle [2] [1].\n\nTo better understand which specific interest might apply to your situation or to see if your account involves daily compounding, I'd recommend reviewing your account statement or agreement for detailed interest rate information [4].\n\nSources:\n[1] FAQ Document\n[2] FAQ Document\n[3] FAQ Document\n[4] Account Agreement",

    "question": "cancel card i did not want a hard pull on my account",
    "expected_answer": "If you want to cancel your card because you did not want a hard pull on your account, you should know that a hard inquiry on your credit profile is only made after you accept an offer and schedule a time with notaries. This means a hard pull would have happened after scheduling the notary session [1].\n\nIf you wish to close your account, it is advised to request a payoff letter through the mobile app or by email to [support@aven.com](mailto:support@aven.com). Once balances are paid and are no longer subject to reversal or dispute, Aven will process liens and close the account at the end of the billing cycle [2].\n\nSources:\n[1] FAQ Document\n[2] FAQ Document",

    "agent_answer": "To cancel your Aven card and avoid a hard pull, please contact Aven Support at support@aven.com or call 844-428-3107. They can assist you with the cancellation process. Remember, a hard pull occurs only after you accept an offer and schedule a signing. If you haven't done that, your credit score should not be impacted.",

    "question": "Why can't I get 6.49%?",
    "expected_answer": "The reason you might not be able to get a 6.49% interest rate could be due to the automated underwriting system of Aven, which considers various factors like income, equity, credit, and debt obligations to determine the interest rate. This process is automated and does not allow for manual adjustments to the offers provided, meaning the rate offered by Aven is based on these factors and the current index rate at the time of the offer [1]. Additionally, the Aven Card is a variable rate credit card, and the rate may change based on the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit [1] [3]. Therefore, the current market conditions or your financial profile could have resulted in a different rate being offered to you.\n\nSources:\n[1] FAQ Document\n[2] FAQ Document\n[3] FAQ Document",

    "agent_answer": "Aven's rates are determined by an automated underwriting system based on your creditworthiness, income, equity, and debt obligations. The best rates are available only to the highest-qualified borrowers. If you do not qualify for the lowest rates, it may be due to your credit profile or other factors. The maximum APR is capped at 18%. For more details, please check your account agreement.",
